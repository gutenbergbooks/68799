<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MRS. WENTWORTH WARD VISITS GLEN
ARDEN.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was raining heavily, and a
strong wind from the northeast blew the drops with relentless
force against the dining-room windows. The few leaves that
remained upon the trees were fast dropping, falling in sodden
unloveliness upon the drenched lawn. It was a day for all those
who could do so to remain within doors.</p>
<p>The four girls were in the dining-room. It was the most
cheerful place in which to sit on a rainy day, and the fire that
burned on the hearth lighted up the room, and gave it an aspect
of cosiness that was very pleasant.</p>
<p>Honor Starr, the eldest of the family, was lying upon the
sofa, which had been drawn forward from its usual corner and
placed within reach of the warmth. She had a book in her hand, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>although she
was not reading at the moment. She also held a bottle of camphor,
which she applied frequently to her nose.</p>
<p>Sophy, the youngest sister, who was only eight years old, sat
at a table near the side window, brandishing first a large pair
of shears, and then a paint or a paste brush, while sheets of
tissue paper, of every hue known to a maker of paper dolls, lay
about her on the floor, and were mingled with the contents of an
overflowing waste-basket which had just been upset.</p>
<p>Katherine, who was eighteen, and who came next in age to
Honor, had been showing to her sisters a very handsome
silver-backed handglass, which she had bought the day before in
Boston, and apparently there had been some argument on the
subject, for Katherine&rsquo;s pretty face wore a perturbed
expression, and she glanced somewhat resentfully at Honor, who
was then devoting herself to the camphor bottle with conspicuous
attention.</p>
<p>Victoria, the third sister, a girl of fifteen, knelt before
the fire, to which she energetically applied the poker. Victoria
was apt to use energy in the smallest affairs of life. The girls
were all dressed <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>in black, which perhaps added to the effect of
dreariness caused by the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, she won&rsquo;t come to-day!&rdquo; said
Katherine, laying down the mirror and going to the window, whence
a view of the drive was to be had. The house was set low, and was
at some distance from the main road. The avenue leading to the
house wound in and out among the trees, but there was one portion
of it which was open, and could be seen easily from the windows.
This open space Katherine was watching with scrupulous care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dog wouldn&rsquo;t put his nose out of doors to-day,
if he could help it,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sophia is no dog,&rdquo; observed Victoria, coming
behind her and peering over her shoulder; &ldquo;she is a Woman,
spelt with a capital W; therefore wind and weather will never
keep her at home. I heard the whistle of the train, ages ago.
And&mdash;yes, there she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the four sisters together, as a
depot carriage came rapidly into sight and was then lost again
among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy, do straighten up that table! Your chips are
everywhere! And pick up the <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>waste-basket!&rdquo; cried Katherine,
turning hastily from the window. &ldquo;Why did you choose to-day
of all others to make paper-doll dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kathie, you know I <i>always</i> play paper dolls
on Saturday, especially if it is a rainy one!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sophy, with reproachful emphasis; &ldquo;and you told me
yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children, don&rsquo;t waste the time in useless
arguments,&rdquo; interrupted Victoria. &ldquo;Aunt Sophia is
here, and we ought to have been ready for her, for we might have
known she would come. Honor, it will give her fifty fits on the
spot if she finds you on the sofa reading a novel at this hour.
<i>Do</i> get up and look brisk, even if you don&rsquo;t feel
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria was flying about the room, as she spoke, moving a
chair here, and straightening a rug there, beating up a down
pillow which still bore the indentation left by the last person
who had leaned against it, and whisking out of the way the large
box which was standing open upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your bargain of a silver handglass, Katherine.
I advise you to keep that well out of Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s
sight,&rdquo; she said; and then steps <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>were heard upon the piazza, the front
door was opened, and there came in at the same time and with
equal force, Mrs. Wentworth Ward of Boston and a strong gust of
wind from the northeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Sophia!&rdquo; exclaimed Honor, rising slowly
from her sofa, which was in full view of the hall. &ldquo;Is it
really you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really I,&rdquo; replied her aunt; &ldquo;and who
else should it be, or why should it not be I? How do you all do?
Honor, what is the matter that you are lying down at this hour of
the day? Victoria, take my waterproof to the kitchen to be dried,
if you please. Katherine, your hand, while I take off my
overshoes! Sophia, come here, child, and give me a kiss! You
smell of flour paste and are very sticky. What have you been
doing? There, now I am ready to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked into the dining-room and placed herself in a large
chair at a discreet distance from the fire. She was a tall
woman&mdash;all the Starrs were tall&mdash;and of proportionate
width. Her forehead was broad and high, and above it the gray
hair was parted and brushed smoothly back on <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>either side
of her face. Her nose was rather large and was perfectly
straight, her teeth were exceptionally good, and her complexion
might have been called &ldquo;high colored.&rdquo; She was
president, or vice-president, or at least director, of no one
knows how many charitable, literary, and musical societies in
Boston, and she was noted for her rare executive ability. Among
the other things which she tried to manage were her nieces the
Starrs, and she found them by no means the least difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are brave to come to the country on such a day as
this,&rdquo; murmured Honor, sinking again upon the sofa, but not
actually lying down. She was conscious that she was inviting
censure both by speech and action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always keep my engagements,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Wentworth Ward. &ldquo;If women did not keep their engagements,
what would become of mankind? Ten days ago I wrote on my
memorandum calendar for November third, &lsquo;Glen Arden, 9
<span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> train.&rsquo; A woman should
be as exact as a railroad time-table, whatever the weather. It is
the only way to accomplish anything in this world. The 9 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> train has arrived, and so have
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>She
paused, but no one spoke. It was apparent that she intended to
enforce a lesson, and she gave her nieces a moment in which to
digest it. In the meantime Victoria returned from her expedition
to the kitchen with her aunt&rsquo;s waterproof, and as she
entered the room she glanced hastily about.</p>
<p>Victoria, though only fifteen, was keenly sensitive, and it
seemed to her that the intellectual atmosphere was surcharged
with a high explosive, ready to go off with a loud report should
a match be applied to it. She was quite sure that her aunt held
the match and had come to Glen Arden this rainy day for the
express purpose of striking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now to business,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wentworth
Ward&mdash;she preferred that the two names should be mentioned
in conjunction. &ldquo;As you may suppose, I had an especial
purpose in coming out here to-day. I have come to the conclusion,
and I think your guardian will fully agree with me, that you
cannot live here any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was just as Victoria had suspected. Aunt Sophia had
struck her match, and an explosion had promptly followed.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;And why not, may I ask?&rdquo; demanded Honor,
sitting upright upon the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed Katherine, with
a vehemence that was scarcely respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sophia, you are trying to frighten us!&rdquo;
remarked Victoria, assuming an air of gaiety that appeared
forced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to live anywhere else,&rdquo;
added Sophy, as if that reason were conclusive. Sophy, being only
eight, had not yet fully realized the aunt for whom she was
named.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wentworth Ward looked from one to the other of her four
nieces. She appeared to be quite unmoved by their excitement.
There can be no surprise for the one who strikes the match on
occasions of this kind, and Mrs. Wentworth Ward prided herself
always upon being equal to an occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt so at the time that your father died,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;but I said nothing. There was no one who could
come here then to live with you, and it was not convenient for me
to ask you to live with me; but in the three months which have
elapsed since then, I have reached a decision. It is my way, as
you know, to think over my plans carefully before making them
known to others. <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>I have thought them over, and now I tell you. It is
neither seemly nor proper&mdash;and there are other reasons, too,
which make it impossible&mdash;that my nieces and nephew should
continue to live here alone. By the way, where is
Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s sisters did not seem inclined to reply, until
Victoria, fearing lest the silence should exasperate her aunt,
volunteered the information that he was down at the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went an hour ago to attend to his rabbits,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I suppose he is there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not know that I was coming?&rdquo; asked her
aunt. &ldquo;Why rabbits when I am expected? But, after all, that
is neither here nor there. You are all to come and live with me.
In other words, my house shall be your home henceforth. Honor
shall act as my secretary. Honor, you have the ability, and there
is no reason why you should not turn it to account, instead of
spending your time on a sofa. Indeed, I have not yet been told
why you are on the sofa. Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a cold. But, Aunt Sophia, suppose I don&rsquo;t
care to be your secretary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot suppose anything so impossible,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Wentworth Ward, imperturbably; &ldquo;for <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of course you
will be only too glad to do something for me in return for the
many advantages which life in town will give you. Katherine can
perfect herself in music, at the same time taking charge of the
<i>bric-&aacute;-brac</i>. That shall be her duty. I have decided
it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; observed Katherine. &ldquo;I
invariably break <i>bric-&aacute;-brac</i> when I handle it. I
should advise you to make a different arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victoria shall continue to go to school,&rdquo;
continued her aunt, ignoring this suggestion. &ldquo;In fact, she
and Sophy and Peter are to go to boarding-school. I have already
written and made the necessary arrangements. They can spend their
holidays with me on Beacon Street. I shall take you into society,
when our period of mourning is over. Next winter you can begin to
go out a little. In fact, you can go to concerts this winter, and
to lectures. It will be quite proper. I intend that your minds
shall be improved. Honor, what is that book which I see peeping
from beneath your pillow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The awkward pause which followed was broken by Victoria, who
hastened to divert her aunt&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Honor has such a cold,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>gave her
some of your remedy, Aunt Sophia, and it has worked wonders. Did
you tell us to take it every three or every four
hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every three hours, until the cold begins to mend, and
after that, every four. You did quite right, Victoria. There is
nothing like it. I cured your uncle once in less than a day and a
half. And what did you say was the name of the book,
Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you have ever heard of it, Aunt
Sophia,&rdquo; said Honor, as she drew it forth from its
hiding-place. &ldquo;The name of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t stop to discuss books!&rdquo;
cried Katherine. &ldquo;There is something else far more
important to be talked about. We don&rsquo;t want to go to Boston
to live, Aunt Sophia. We don&rsquo;t want to be your secretary
and dust your <i>bric-&aacute;-brac</i>. We don&rsquo;t want to
go to boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wentworth Ward looked at her calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, that makes no particular difference,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;We cannot always do what we wish. I am your
father&rsquo;s sister, and it is proper that you should live with
me. It was very much like your father to omit making me <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>your legal
guardian. Why he should have appointed Dickinson Abbott instead
of me, I cannot imagine, but he did, and what is done cannot be
undone. However, that is neither here nor there. I offer you a
home with me. You are too young to live here alone, and there are
other reasons against it also. It is quite out of the
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A profound silence followed this speech. The plan proposed by
their aunt was so appalling that the girls were unable to collect
their ideas sufficiently to reply. Mrs. Wentworth Ward took out
her watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must return in the next train,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I have a charity association meeting at half after eleven.
I preferred to see you all together and tell you this, rather
than send for one of you to come to me, or rather than write to
you. This room looks rather disorderly, I think. Honor, that is a
wretched waitress of yours. When you come to Beacon Street, I
will give you lessons in housekeeping. This place had better be
rented; you cannot keep it up otherwise. Katherine, what have you
been buying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady had risen and had been walking <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>about the
room on a tour of inspection, while she thus criticised. She was
standing now in a little recess formed by the window curtain. On
a table within it was the silversmith&rsquo;s box, the lid half
off, and in the paper which had wrapped it, the address
&ldquo;Miss Katherine Starr&rdquo; being in full view. The tissue
papers which covered the contents were ruthlessly drawn aside by
Mrs. Wentworth Ward, and the silver mirror exposed to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you have not been buying this!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, holding it up and looking first at her own countenance
reflected in the one side and then at the large monogram of
&ldquo;K. R. S.&rdquo; engraved upon the frosted surface of the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, Aunt Sophia! Why not?&rdquo; returned her
niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you give for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an awfully odd question, Aunt Sophia, but
fortunately I don&rsquo;t mind telling you. It was only fifteen
dollars. It is a gem, isn&rsquo;t it, for the price? And it
matches the rest of my silver beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you get the money to buy such a thing as
this with?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Aunt Sophia! My own money, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own money! Then let me tell you, Katherine, that
there is very little money for you to call your own, and none to
throw away on silver handglasses. I really don&rsquo;t know what
you are thinking of, nor Dickinson Abbott, either! When you come
to live with me I shall teach you economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we do!&rdquo; murmured Katherine, as she replaced
the glass in its wrappings and put it back in the box.
Fortunately the rustle of the paper rendered her remark
inaudible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor, it is absurd!&rdquo; continued Mrs. Wentworth
Ward. &ldquo;What do you mean by allowing Katherine to spend
money in this way? You are simply a parcel of children, and it is
more than time that there was some one to keep you in
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine has a perfect right to spend her money as she
pleases, Aunt Sophia,&rdquo; said Honor. She had been
remonstrating sharply with her sister upon this very subject
before the arrival of their aunt, but now she warmly espoused her
cause in the presence of their common enemy. &ldquo;It is her
money. I have nothing to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>And she
again removed the stopper of the camphor bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! you are the eldest of the family, and the
responsibility lies with you. That eternal application of camphor
is bad for you, Honor. It does not really cure you, either. The
relief is only temporary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be temporary, but is very pleasant,&rdquo; said
Honor; &ldquo;as pleasant as anything can be when one has a bad
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come to me the first of December,&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Ward, paying no further attention to these matters
of minor importance, but reverting to her chief topic.
&ldquo;Peter and the younger girls will go next week to school,
as the term has begun, and no time should be lost. It will be
just as well to have them out of the way when you are closing up
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Sophia,&rdquo; cried Honor, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t really mean all this! Why should we do it? Why should
we leave our home? Why can&rsquo;t we stay on here as our dear
father intended we should? I am twenty-one, and quite capable of
looking after the others, and the children are well placed at
school. You are very kind to make all <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>these arrangements for us, but though
we thank you very much, we don&rsquo;t want to accept them. We
prefer to stay as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victoria, kindly see if the carriage has come back for
me. I told the man to be here without fail,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wentworth Ward, snapping the lid of her watch as she spoke.
&ldquo;Katherine, help me with my cloak, if you please. Is it
dry? Ah, yes, Honor, when you see Dickinson Abbott, you will be
made to understand why these arrangements have become necessary.
It is easy to talk of living on here, but it requires money to do
that&mdash;money, and you have scarcely a cent. The carriage has
come, Victoria? Very well, then, good-bye! Tell Peter he should
have come in to see me. You will hear from me again next week. In
the meantime you had better begin your packing. I will come out
and help you to put the house in order to let. I am sorry I have
not time to stay longer, but after all, further discussion is
unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again the front door was opened, again the northeast wind
blew in, and Mrs. Wentworth Ward of Boston went out.</p>
<p>The door had scarcely closed behind her when <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>that leading
from the back of the house to the hall was carefully opened, and
a boy&rsquo;s face appeared at the crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she gone?&rdquo; inquired the owner of the face in
a loud whisper. &ldquo;I say, Vic, has she gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Victoria did not reply. She had hastened to rejoin her
sisters in the dining-room after bidding her aunt good-bye, and
they were now looking at one another in consternation. What did
Aunt Sophia mean?</p>
<p>Peter, seeing for himself that the coast was clear, sauntered
into the room.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE STARRS HOLD A FAMILY
COUNCIL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Peter Starr</span> was the only boy among
four sisters. Had he been questioned closely upon the subject, he
probably would have replied, &ldquo;Yes, and there are four too
many!&rdquo; This is what he would have said, perhaps, but it is
doubtful if such a reply would have been altogether truthful.
Peter&rsquo;s sisters were very useful to him, at times, although
there were occasions when it would have been pleasant to do
exactly that which he, and he alone, wished to do, instead of
being dragged in four different directions by the conflicting
opinions of his four sisters.</p>
<p>Sophy he could manage, it was true, and Victoria he thought he
managed, though sometimes it occurred to him to wonder if Vic
were not in reality managing him, unknown to himself. But Honor
and Katherine openly defied him, and were fond of ordering him
about in a manner which was annoying, to say the least. Peter
spent <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the
greater part of his time in endeavoring to frustrate the plans
made by Honor and Katherine in his behalf.</p>
<p>To-day, fortunately for him, Honor&rsquo;s cold prevented her
from being aware of the odor of the barn which accompanied him
into the room, and Katherine was too much absorbed in the
conversation to remark upon it. Victoria and Sophy did not notice
those things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the ancient war-horse gone?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you oughtn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; remonstrated
Honor; &ldquo;indeed you shouldn&rsquo;t call her
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I am sure she is ancient, and she is a
war-horse, for she loves a battle and the sound of prancings.
She&rsquo;s always arguing about something or other. What was it
to-day? I heard her talking, so I stayed in the kitchen till she
had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor tried to look shocked, but the others laughed audibly
and then quickly became silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better send for Mr. Abbott,&rdquo; said
Victoria, &ldquo;and find out just what Aunt Sophia means. If she
only could have taken time to explain to us a little!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;That is a good idea,&rdquo; said Honor and
Katherine together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will telegraph him this morning and ask him to come
out as soon as possible,&rdquo; added Honor. &ldquo;Perhaps he
will come this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all this storm?&rdquo; asked Victoria, glancing at
the weather.</p>
<p>The rain was descending in torrents, pattering on the tin roof
of the piazza, and pouring in a steady stream from the
water-spout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Honor. &ldquo;Aunt Sophia came,
and Mr. Abbott doesn&rsquo;t mind weather. You know he told us to
send for him whenever we needed him, and I am sure we need him
now. Probably he will come out this afternoon. Peter, put on your
rubber coat, please, and be sure to wear your rubber
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Peter, calmly. &ldquo;I am very
comfortable as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go to the station with a telegram, child, of course!
Vic, give me a pencil and paper, please, and I will write it. I
wish you would get some telegraph blanks, Peter. Do bring some
home with you, for they are such a convenience. Now, let me see.
&lsquo;Mr. Dickinson Abbott,&mdash;State <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Street,
Boston. Aunt Sophia has been here and has told
us&rsquo;&mdash;dear me, that is nine words before I began to
tell him what she has told us,&rdquo; said Honor, biting the end
of her pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is ever so much you can scratch out,&rdquo;
said Katherine, taking the paper. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sophia,&rsquo;
for one. He knows we have only one aunt&mdash;for which blessing
let us be thankful! &lsquo;Aunt has been here and
says&mdash;&rsquo; no, &lsquo;Aunt here and says we must go there
to live because&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it do to put all that in a telegram?&rdquo;
queried Victoria. &ldquo;Why not just say, &lsquo;Please come and
see us; we want to talk to you on matters of
importance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do very well,&rdquo; said Katherine, writing
it, &ldquo;and only fifteen words. Those extra five won&rsquo;t
cost much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could leave out &lsquo;please,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary to be so very polite in a
telegram,&rdquo; remarked Honor, as she erased the word,
&ldquo;and if it is true that we have no money, we had better
begin at once to be economical. And we could say &lsquo;important
matters,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;matters of importance.&rsquo;
That would bring it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;And save five cents, I suppose,&rdquo; laughed
Katherine, derisively. &ldquo;However, far be it from me to
frustrate your good intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Honor, laying down her pencil and
reading the amended message; &ldquo;&lsquo;Come see us. We want
to talk on important matters.&rsquo; Exactly ten words, and now
my name&mdash;&lsquo;Honor Starr.&rsquo; Peter, are you ready?
Why, you haven&rsquo;t stirred! Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all his sisters with one voice exclaimed reproachfully,
&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with Peter?&rdquo;
inquired that youth as he extended first one foot and then the
other to the genial warmth of the blaze. He was sitting in an
arm-chair before the fire. He was leaning back, and his hands
were in his pockets. Peter was tall for his age, which was
thirteen, and well developed. His hair and eyes were brown, as
were those of all the family but Victoria, and he looked very
much like Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you not ready? You know we want you to go to
the telegraph office. There is no time to be lost, for Mr. Abbott
will have gone home. It is Saturday, and you know he always <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>leaves the
office early on Saturday. <i>Do</i> hurry, Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the sisters were talking at once, even Sophy adding her
voice to the clamor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool! keep cool!&rdquo; remarked Peter, continuing
to warm his feet; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the telegram to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Abbott, you <i>know</i>, Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ask him to come. You have heard us talking, Peter!
Surely you are not deaf. Do hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? You needn&rsquo;t telegraph
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Oh, don&rsquo;t stop to argue, you dreadful
boy!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Just go at once. We want Mr.
Abbott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re going to get him, and I&rsquo;m not
going out in this storm when there&rsquo;s no reason for it. Mr.
Abbott is coming this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Peter, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram came from him this morning. I was at the
station when it came, and the operator read it off to me while it
was coming, as he said it was to us. I&rsquo;m going to learn
telegraphy some day. It must be lots of fun to read all the
messages and know what everybody is telegraphing
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>He was
searching in his pockets as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have left it down at the barn, but it was only
to say he was coming on the two-twenty train. I&rsquo;ll get it
when I go down to give the rabbits their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there ever was such a provoking boy
as you!&rdquo; exclaimed Honor, lying back upon the sofa, quite
exhausted by her brief moment of activity in writing the
telegram. &ldquo;If you only could have told us this
before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask me, and you didn&rsquo;t give me a
chance, either,&rdquo; responded Peter. &ldquo;And now I wish
you&rsquo;d tell me something. What is all this fuss about, and
what do you want Mr. Abbott for? What kind of a shindy has the
war-horse been cutting up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says that you children are to go to
boarding-school, and that Honor and I are to go live with
her,&rdquo; replied Katherine.</p>
<p>Peter gave a long, low whistle and stared at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we can help it,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! Neither am I. Go to boarding-school! Live
with Aunt Sophia! Whew!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>And the
five sat there in silence for a few moments, while the wind blew
and the rain poured down without, and their Aunt Sophia was being
borne rapidly back to Boston in the train, satisfied that she had
accomplished her object and had done her duty, and that even now
her nieces had begun to make ready for their flight from the old
home.</p>
<p>The Starrs had lived at Glen Arden all their lives. They were
all born in the old house, as had been also their father and
their grandfather. So had their Aunt Sophia, as to that matter;
but apparently her early marriage had counteracted the effect of
old associations. She had no time to give to sentiment, and she
considered that a home on Beacon Street would amply compensate
her brother&rsquo;s children for whatever they should be forced
to forego.</p>
<p>She was sorry for them, it is true, but her sympathy was
somewhat diluted by the reflection that she had always said that
her brother and her brother&rsquo;s wife were extravagant. The
state of the family finances at present only went to prove the
truth of this statement, and she was more than convinced that
Katherine had inherited the <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>expensive tastes of her parents.
Fifteen dollars for a handglass! Mrs. Wentworth Ward bristled
with indignation at the thought of it.</p>
<p>It was three months now since Mr. Peter Starr had died. His
wife had been dead for some years, and the children might be said
to have brought themselves up. There had been no one to go there
to take charge when their mother died, and though there had been
an occasional governess, she had been granted but little
authority, and affairs went more smoothly when there was no
one.</p>
<p>The girls adored their father, and his slightest word was law
when he chose to speak it; but as a rule he refrained from
directing his family in the smaller matters of life. He was an
indolent, dreamy man, who since his wife&rsquo;s death had spent
the greater part of his time among his books. Mrs. Wentworth Ward
had frequently remonstrated with him upon the laxity of his
management of his children, but he had acquired the habit of
thinking that Sophia was unduly particular, and therefore he paid
but little attention to her criticisms. Honor kept house very
well, he always said, and the children never gave him any
trouble. He liked them to be natural.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>It was
in August that Mr. Starr died, so suddenly that it was many weeks
before his family could realize the fact that the gentle, kindly
presence was no longer among them. They missed their father
sadly, and Honor sometimes felt overburdened with a sense of the
responsibility which was now hers. To be sure, she had kept house
for years, and had practically brought up the younger children;
but there had always been her father to turn to in matters of
importance, there had always been his smile to encourage her, his
few words of appreciation to cheer her when the children had been
troublesome, or household affairs had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson Abbott, an old friend of Mr. Starr&rsquo;s, had,
according to his will, been appointed guardian of the family and
trustee of the estate. There had always been plenty of money, and
Honor had supposed that there always would be. She could not
imagine what her Aunt Sophia had meant by her remarks that
morning.</p>
<p>Katherine had finished school, but intended to devote herself
to her music this winter, going to Boston several times a week
for the purpose, and practising with great regularity and
industry. <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Katherine, though inclined to be flighty and
unmanageable at times, was wholly devoted to music. Victoria,
Sophy, and Peter went to private schools in Fordham, upon the
outskirts of which suburban town Glen Arden was situated.</p>
<p>Glen Arden itself was a beautiful old place on the banks of
the Charles River. A pine grove hid the view of the river from
the house, but the gentle, winding stream was there within a
stone&rsquo;s throw of the barn, and at the foot of the steep
bank with which the grove terminated. A small branch railroad
crossed the river at the Starrs&rsquo; place, and a tiny station
was situated near the entrance to their grounds. The main station
was half a mile away in &ldquo;the village,&rdquo; as the Starrs
continued to designate it, although it had long ago been
incorporated into the city of Fordham.</p>
<p>Shortly after twelve o&rsquo;clock of this eventful Saturday
in November the rain abated somewhat, and at three, when the
train arrived upon which Mr. Abbott was expected, it had actually
ceased for the time being at least.</p>
<p>The girls were in the parlor, Katherine at the piano, and
Honor with a bit of work in her hands. She had revived somewhat,
and sat curled up in a <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>corner of the divan which occupied
the western window. There was never much light in the parlor of
Glen Arden even on a clear day, for the trees grew so thick near
the house. Mr. Starr and his father before him had loved each
individual tree, and many of them had been planted with their own
hands, usually upon some occasion for family rejoicing. The love
of their trees was a family heritage.</p>
<p>Victoria was on her knees before the hearth, coaxing into a
blaze the logs which had been heaped there. With each puff of the
bellows a small flame leaped up, lighting her face and dancing
before her intently gazing brown eyes. Vic was not considered to
be as pretty as Honor or Katherine, but already a fair amount of
character was depicted in her face. Her features were too
irregular for beauty, but her hair was pretty. There was not much
of it, for it was so curly that it had never grown beyond her
shoulders, but its color of reddish gold was very striking, and
in the firelight this afternoon it looked like a golden halo
which framed her flushed face.</p>
<p>No one knew yet in just which direction Victoria&rsquo;s
character would develop, but her family had <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>a latent
conviction that she would &ldquo;be something,&rdquo; for in many
ways she was so unlike other people.</p>
<p>Peter and Sophy had gone to the train to meet Mr. Abbott, who
was a prime favorite with them all, and presently they were seen
coming along the grassy path, which led under the trees across
the lawn directly from the little station, and was a much shorter
course than to follow the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here you all are!&rdquo; said Mr. Abbott, when he
had divested himself of his mackintosh in the hall and had come
into the parlor. &ldquo;Every one of you; and Vic has made a
grand fire to cheer the wanderer and the wayfarer this rainy day.
Nasty weather, this! Honor, how did you get such a cold? You must
take care of it, child. I don&rsquo;t like those pale
cheeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good you are to come out such a day, Mr.
Abbott!&rdquo; said Honor, as she drew forward an arm-chair for
her guest. &ldquo;Just as good as you can be. We want to see you
so much, and were on the point of telegraphing to you when we
heard of your message to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is good!&rdquo; said he, leaning forward and
warming his hands at the blaze. He was a tall, broad-shouldered
man of about sixty-five, <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>with gray hair and beard, and kindly
eyes. The Starrs all loved him dearly, and he had been their
father&rsquo;s most valued friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to come where I am wanted,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and I am always glad to come here. Dear me, though, I
can&rsquo;t get used to it without your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can we,&rdquo; said Honor, her eyes filling
with tears as she spoke. &ldquo;Everything is changed without
him, and Aunt Sophia has been here to-day and wants to make more
changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, your aunt has been here, has she?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Abbott, quickly. &ldquo;And what plan did she
suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you know about it, and is it really true,
then?&rdquo; asked Honor, wonderingly. &ldquo;And have you come
to tell us the same thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know, my dear, until I hear what she has told
you?&rdquo; said he, with an attempt at lightness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most absurd thing you ever heard of,&rdquo; said
Katherine. &ldquo;She says we must go there to live. Just fancy
us living with Aunt Sophia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that we are to go to boarding-school,&rdquo; put in
Sophy, who had seated herself on the arm of her guardian&rsquo;s
chair.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;And that we must rent the place,&rdquo; continued
Honor. &ldquo;Rent this place where no one has ever lived but
Starrs! Just imagine what father&rsquo;s feelings would have been
if it had ever been suggested to him that strangers should have
Glen Arden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch me going to Boston to live,&rdquo; remarked
Peter. &ldquo;I could stand boarding-school on a pinch, but
Boston, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria said nothing, but she watched Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s
face. She noticed that it had become very grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it! Why, Mr. Abbott, why should we do it? Of
course we don&rsquo;t like it. The very idea is absurd.&rdquo;
They were all talking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Aunt Sophia suggest such a preposterous
arrangement?&rdquo; continued Honor. &ldquo;We are very much
alone, it is true; but we can&rsquo;t help that. I have always
been in the habit of keeping house; father really had very little
to do with it. Of course it is very hard to be without him, but
we must make up our minds to that, and get along as best we can.
We can do that better here, where every corner of the house and
place is associated with him, and which he loved, than we could
if we <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>went
to live with Aunt Sophia. Why, Mr. Abbott, it would simply kill
us all to live with Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it would,&rdquo; added the others, with
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said their guardian, gravely,
&ldquo;your Aunt Sophia is very good to offer to do all this for
you. I didn&rsquo;t know whether she would or not. But I have
known her for forty years or more, and I have always found that
she did what she considered to be her duty. Trust a New England
woman for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Honor, in alarm.
&ldquo;Why is it her duty, Mr. Abbott? Father intended that we
should live here. He left it so in his will, didn&rsquo;t he? Why
should Aunt Sophia suggest anything different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Abbott, rising as he spoke,
and standing with his back to the fire, &ldquo;I may as well tell
you plainly. It is what I came this afternoon to do. There is
very little money for you to live on. Your father&rsquo;s affairs
were&mdash;well, were somewhat involved. An investment which he
thought very highly of, and in which he put about all he owned,
has gone to pieces since his death. <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>I am glad he never knew it. There is
all this real estate, to be sure; but that means nothing in the
present state of the market. You have,&mdash;I must speak
plainly, my dear children,&mdash;you have practically nothing to
live upon at present. Your aunt is very good to offer you a home
and your education. I went to see her a week ago, to tell her the
state of affairs, and since then I have been thinking over how it
was best to tell you, and what had better be done. I could not
put it off any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that we are really poor?&rdquo; asked
Honor, in a quiet voice, when he had finished speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poor, indeed. You have scarcely
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean by &lsquo;scarcely
anything&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the place, which is an expensive one to keep
up, and a very few hundred dollars a year, upon which to live and
be educated and clothed. Your aunt&rsquo;s offer is a relief to
me. I am glad she made it, but, as I say, I thought she would.
Sophia Ward may be peculiar, and perhaps a trifle aggravating,
but she is certainly conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
Starrs gazed at one another blankly. An unkind fate appeared to
be descending upon them, in a great black cloud. They did not
realize yet the fact that they were poor. This knowledge was
entirely swallowed up by the deplorable prospect of carrying out
the views of their Aunt Sophia, by going to live with her. They
had counted upon their guardian&rsquo;s support in declining her
invitation, and now to their surprise he declared that they were
fortunate to have received it. They were too ignorant of poverty
to know what other significance his words might have.</p>
<p>It was Victoria who reverted to this part of the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that we
haven&rsquo;t got enough money to live on? That if we stay here,
we&mdash;it really seems absurd to say it, but I want to know
exactly, Mr. Abbott&mdash;we shan&rsquo;t have enough to eat,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really mean it,&rdquo; replied her guardian.</p>
<p>He did not tell them that there was actually no money which
they could call their own. The &ldquo;few hundreds&rdquo; of
which he had vaguely spoken, he intended to give them from his
own income, and he was far from being a rich man.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening, and Mr. Abbott had
returned to Boston. He had declined staying to dinner, but had
promised to come again early in the week. By that time the Starrs
would have more fully realized the situation, and would be able
to talk more rationally, he thought. He must give them time to
accustom themselves to the great change in their prospects. At
present they seemed to be stunned, and no wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is terrible, terrible!&rdquo; said Mr. Abbott as he
left Glen Arden. &ldquo;Poor children! I am sorry for them. I am
only thankful that my old friend was spared the knowledge of it
all. Peter never was a business man, and if he had taken my
advice, his money would never have gone into such a worthless
concern as that railroad has proved to be. Poor children, I am
sorry enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Abbott had no children of his own, but he had a
father&rsquo;s heart, and it ached as he thought <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of the
sad-faced group which he had just left. They knew so little of
life, and it seemed to be beginning badly for them.</p>
<p>Dinner was eaten almost in silence, but afterwards, when the
family had returned to the parlor and the lamps were lighted, and
the room looked just as they had always known it since they could
remember,&mdash;except that the dear father was no longer
there,&mdash;Honor&rsquo;s self-control, which she had bravely
kept until now, deserted her for an instant. She covered her face
with her handkerchief and gave a little sob. Then she quickly
dried her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will not</i> give way!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
I once do, it will be the end of everything; and we must keep
calm and try to think clearly. I see no way out of it, girls. It
really seems as if we must give up, and go live<sup>-</sup>with
Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine started from her chair and began to walk rapidly up
and down the room. Katherine was tall and very slender, and her
eyes and hair were the darkest of the family. She was an
excitable person, and this remark of Honor&rsquo;s, although it
entirely coincided with what she feared, had a most exasperating
effect upon her.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Honor, how can you
say such a thing? Are you going to meekly give in and do just
what Aunt Sophia says, after all? I should think you would have
more spirit. I&mdash;I would rather do anything than that.
Scrubbing floors would be better than dusting Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s
ugly china, and writing her endless notes about stupid meetings.
Really, Honor, I am surprised that you can sit there and calmly
say you are willing to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that I was willing,&rdquo; said
Honor; &ldquo;and, Katherine, you know I am not. And, as for
being calm&mdash;but what is the use of discussing that? We have
got to live, and we have no money; therefore, if some one offers
us homes and educations, I suppose there is nothing for us to do
but say, &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; and meekly take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, but I never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give music lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where will you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Board somewhere alone, I suppose. Lots of women do that
who have to support themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not women that are as young as you are, and who
have been brought up as you have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help my bringing up, and I shall
rapidly grow older, and I <i>will not</i> go to Aunt
Sophia&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;I have
been thinking about it since before dinner, and what Katherine
says about supporting herself just fits in with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Honor and Katherine together.
They had a great respect for Victoria&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we all do something to support
ourselves? Lots of girls do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they do!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Vic,
you&rsquo;re a girl after my own heart. <i>You&rsquo;re</i> not
going to sit quietly down on Beacon Street and be ordered about
by Aunt Sophia!&rdquo; This with a glance at Honor, who was too
much interested in Victoria&rsquo;s proposition, however, to
notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think we could?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;What could we do? Katherine has her music, I know, but
there is no particular talent that I have, and you haven&rsquo;t
finished school, and there are Peter and Sophy. They
couldn&rsquo;t do anything. And I suppose we should have to leave
the place just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I am coming to,&rdquo; replied <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Victoria.
&ldquo;It popped into my head before Mr. Abbott went, and I have
been thinking about it ever since, and Peter could help a lot if
we carry it out, and Sophy too. Why can&rsquo;t we stay on here,
and turn the place to some account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, what do you mean?&rdquo; cried Honor; and even
Peter, who had been sitting moodily by a distant table, taking no
apparent interest in the conversation, but absorbed in his own
gloomy reflections, dropped the paper-cutter which he had been
handling and drew nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Vic?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;and what
can I do to help? It has been bothering me that I can&rsquo;t do
anything as long as I am the only boy in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria looked at him lovingly. She wished that she might
venture to give him a hug for that speech, but she knew that
Peter would not like it, so she refrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that we might live on
here and make the place pay. We could sell the farm produce, sell
the milk&mdash;you know we have all those cows. Surely we
can&rsquo;t use all the milk and cream they must give, and there
must be horrible waste. Then we could raise other things. <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>I have a
thousand ideas. Or hens! We might keep hens and sell the eggs. Or
violets! Or mushrooms! I heard of some one not long ago who made
a fortune and went abroad on mushrooms and violets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s voice rose with her rapidly increasing
enthusiasm. She could see that she had made a point. Her sisters
were distinctly impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shouldn&rsquo;t have to give up the place, after
all!&rdquo; cried Honor. &ldquo;Victoria, you are brilliant! Come
here, child, and let me kiss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we could have a school,&rdquo; continued Victoria.
&ldquo;Katherine could teach the music, and I the small children,
while you, Honor, would be the principal. It might even be a
boarding-school. We have lots of room. Indeed, girls, there are
ever so many things we can do if we only put our minds to it. The
farming project seems really the best plan, though, for Peter
could be of such use there. He loves out-of-door things so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about the children&rsquo;s schooling?&rdquo;
suggested Honor. &ldquo;If we had a school here, we could teach
Sophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;I thought of that.
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>We have
got to talk the whole thing over and consult with Mr. Abbott. It
requires a lot of thought. But I am glad you see some good in the
idea. I was almost afraid to suggest it for fear you would frown
it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frown down anything that would save us from a life at
No.&mdash;Beacon Street?&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Never!
Victoria, my child, you have preserved my reason. I verily
believe I should have become quite insane if we had been made to
go to Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s, after all. I must give vent to my
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she seated herself at the piano and played so madly and
yet so brilliantly that the others were forced to listen to her,
partly because they wanted to and partly because they could not
hear one another&rsquo;s voices above the din of the crashing
chords. When she had finished, she twirled around on the piano
stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Now I feel better
and can discuss it calmly. I already see myself sailing for
Germany to study under foreign masters, my pockets stuffed with
the proceeds of music lessons and violets. How shall we sell
them? Shall we send Sophy in to stand at the <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>corner of
Tremont Street and Temple Place with little bunches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kathie!&rdquo; cried Sophy, reproachfully. &ldquo;Must
I really, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said Honor, reassuringly.
&ldquo;Katherine is only teasing you. The idea of our letting our
baby do that!&rdquo; While Katherine laughed immoderately at
Sophy&rsquo;s startled face. &ldquo;Now we must talk it over
calmly and get our ideas into shape before we see Mr. Abbott
again, so that we can convince him at once,&rdquo; continued
Honor. &ldquo;Suppose we discuss it to-night, and then think it
over to ourselves to-morrow, and to-morrow night, at this time,
we will each say what we think we had better do. Then we can see
which will be the best plan. Oh, Vicky dear, you are a perfect
treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister Vic is a perfect brick!&rdquo; cried
Katherine, hugging her as she spoke.</p>
<p>Peter said nothing, but walked slowly out of the room, with
his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter has gone up to the workshop to think about
it,&rdquo; remarked Sophy, sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he reminds me of father in that,&rdquo; said
Honor. &ldquo;He always went there after he had <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>had a
disagreeable business letter, or something troublesome. Dearest
father! I am glad he never knew that we were going to be poor, he
would have felt so badly. But do you know, girls, I really
don&rsquo;t mind it a bit, now. I feel as if it were going to be
interesting. Just think of the satisfaction it will be to support
ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to see about my Symphony concert tickets
right away,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
whether I had better go this winter when I heard that we had no
money, but now that we are going to make so much I shall be able
to, and I really ought to do everything to improve my music if I
am going to give lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Honor, though somewhat doubtfully,
Katherine thought. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think, though, that we shall
have to be very economical even though we are going to make so
much. I won&rsquo;t order the jacket at Hollander&rsquo;s I was
thinking of. I&rsquo;ll try at some cheaper place. If you think
it will be very extravagant to have one made to order, I will try
to find one ready made. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Victoria as she spoke. Victoria hesitated.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;I hate to say it, Honor,&rdquo; she said at last,
&ldquo;for you are so generous and good, but it really seems as
if we ought to get on with as few clothes as possible if we are
so very poor. Do you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;at least,
is your last winter&rsquo;s coat really hopeless? Wouldn&rsquo;t
it do this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why of course it would <i>do</i>,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much worn, and it is plain black, but it is
frightfully old-fashioned. It has immense sleeves, and they have
gone down so this year; but I could have them altered at a cheap
tailor&rsquo;s. You are right, Vic. I won&rsquo;t get a new
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are other things we might be economical in
besides clothes,&rdquo; continued Victoria, staring pensively at
the fire. &ldquo;The table, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; cried Honor and Katherine with
one voice. &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t think we ought to starve
ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, but we really needn&rsquo;t have
quite so many things. Salad every day at dinner, for instance,
and olives. And we don&rsquo;t need preserves always for lunch,
nor such a lot of cake made, and&mdash;oh, a great many things.
When I was staying at the Carsons&rsquo; last year I noticed <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that they
didn&rsquo;t have nearly so many things as we do, and yet there
was always enough, and everything was very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the idea of a skimpy table,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;You know father always liked everything to be very nice.
Oh no, my dear! Most of your ideas are good ones, but I really
don&rsquo;t think we ought to starve ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;I think
Honor is right there. Nothing is more horrible than the idea of
not having enough food on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; persisted Victoria.
&ldquo;I only mean that we don&rsquo;t need olives and salad and
preserves to keep us from being hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preserves don&rsquo;t cost us a cent but the
sugar,&rdquo; said Honor. &ldquo;We raise the currants and the
pears and the cherries on the place, and even some of the
strawberries, so there is no extravagance in turning them into
preserves and eating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suggests another idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria.
&ldquo;We might sell preserves at the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange or
somewhere. To be sure, we have always paid a woman to do ours,
but we might <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>learn to do them ourselves, and make some money that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls discussed long and earnestly the new aspect of
affairs, and their many plans for bettering their fortune, and
Sophy sat up unnoticed until past her usual bedtime, so absorbed
were they all in the unlooked-for problem which had been
presented to them that afternoon.</p>
<p>Peter did not appear again, but they heard him whistling in
the workshop when they at last went upstairs to bed. Victoria
went to the door and found him idly sharpening some tools,
apparently giving little thought to the work. She wanted him to
go to bed, but she knew that if she told him so, he would
probably prolong his labors until far into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been talking it all over, Peter,&rdquo; said
she gaily, &ldquo;and we are going to think it out by ourselves
over Sunday; and then Monday night we are going to tell each
other how we want most to set about it,&mdash;making our
fortunes, I mean. I am going to bed, for I can think better in
the dark. I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall go to sleep for ages. You
needn&rsquo;t hurry, but please put out the light in the back
hall when you do come.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>And the
mere assurance that he need not hurry sent Peter to his room
within five minutes.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. When the Starr family awoke, the
clouds were still thick, and the air was heavy with dampness; but
by nine o&rsquo;clock the sun was out, and at service time the
day was clear. Peter and his four sisters went to church, as
usual, and took their places in the family pew,&mdash;Peter at
the end where his father had always sat, even on the very Sunday
before he died. If the minds of the little group in black were
occupied with other thoughts than those suggested by the service,
they gave no outward sign of it. In the afternoon they all went
to Sunday school as usual,&mdash;Honor and Katherine to teach,
and the others to be taught; and after it was over Katherine and
Victoria stayed to the afternoon service. Honor&rsquo;s cold
forced her to go home, and Peter and Sophy accompanied her.</p>
<p>No one mentioned the subject in which they were all so vitally
interested, until the next evening, when they were once more
gathered about the parlor fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Honor, drawing up a chair, and
settling herself as if for the evening, &ldquo;the time has <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>at last come!
I have scarcely been able to wait for night, for every one of you
have looked as if you were bristling with ideas all day; but I
thought I had better not begin the subject by asking for
anything. Suppose we all take turns, beginning with the youngest,
and each say what we think will be the quickest and the surest
way of making our fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sophy felt shy at being called upon, and they all insisted
that Honor should state her own views first, as she was the
eldest. Her idea was to open a boarding-school during the winter,
and to take boarders in summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the place looks so lovely,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;and there would be no necessity if we did that for us to
alter our way of living, as regards the table. We should be
obliged to have everything very nice if people were boarding
here, and that would be such a comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine approved of a school, though perhaps not a
boarding-school, and she thought it would be well for them to
have a little time to themselves in summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall want to go away for a while to get
rested,&rdquo; she remarked; &ldquo;to the seashore or the <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>mountains,
you know, so we had better not have a houseful of boarders. The
school would be better, and I can teach other things in it
besides music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria inclined towards working the farm in some way, in
which Peter agreed with her. She pointed out that boarders in
summer would perhaps be hard to procure, and also that it would
be impossible to go to the mountains or the sea, as Katherine
suggested, and leave the place to take care of itself, even if
there were no boarders, and even if they had made enough money to
warrant such an expense. On the other hand, the working of the
farm presented endless possibilities. There was much good sense
in what she said, as Honor and Katherine were forced to admit.
They determined to wait, however, before actually deciding upon
their future course, until they should see Mr. Abbott; and Honor
wrote to him that night, begging him to come to Glen Arden again
as soon as it should be convenient, as they wished his
advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have some new ideas,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and we
cannot rest until we hear you say they are good ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Abbott replied in person to the note; for <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>he was
sincerely anxious about the welfare of his wards, and was also
curious to know what they had thought of as a means of escape
from the grasp of their Aunt Sophia. He came, therefore, on
Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>At first he was sceptical. The mere idea that five young
persons, all under twenty-two, and four of them girls, should set
out to support themselves, with no experience to call upon, and
in absolute ignorance of the magnitude of that which they were
about to undertake, seemed to him preposterous, and he did not
hesitate to tell them so.</p>
<p>But in spite of himself, he was soon impressed by their
earnestness. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and there was
certainly a fair amount of common sense in their remarks. Mr.
Abbott allowed himself to be persuaded to stay to dinner, and
before the evening was over, he was discussing as eagerly as any
one of them the possibilities of selling butter and of teaching
children their alphabet; while the idea of raising violets
appealed strongly to his flower-loving soul.</p>
<p>He promised, when he bade his wards good night, to call upon
their aunt the next day, and place the subject before her; and he
would do his <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>best to win her approval, difficult as he knew that
would be. In the meantime, they might be sure of his consent and
support. He only wished to impress upon them, however, that they
should decide upon a course which would necessitate as little
outlay as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving money counts for as much as making it, in the
long run,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that. And I
am glad that you live in a place which has good public schools.
Peter&rsquo;s education must not be forgotten, nor should
Victoria&rsquo;s and Sophy&rsquo;s. I shall not approve at all of
any scheme which would interfere with their schooling.
Don&rsquo;t forget that, either.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">KATHERINE AS A FINANCIER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Needless</span> to say, Mrs. Wentworth
Ward disapproved absolutely of her nieces&rsquo; projects. The
mere fact of their defiance of her authority was unheard of, and
that they should dream of such impossible plans for their
self-support she considered at first beneath her notice. The
children could not be in earnest, she said, and she thought it
was scarcely the time for jesting.</p>
<p>When she was finally made to understand that the children were
very much in earnest, she cancelled all her engagements for that
afternoon and hurried to the Boston and Albany station. She must
lose no time in informing them that they should never have her
consent, and that they must at once give up any such absurd ideas
as these undoubtedly were.</p>
<p>Long were the arguments and futile were the discussions which
ensued upon her arrival. She found that her brother&rsquo;s
children had inherited <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>no small amount of the Starr
determination, not to say obstinacy, and when they parted she was
forced to acknowledge herself vanquished, for the time being at
least. Mrs. Wentworth Ward comforted herself with the reflection,
which she did not hesitate to put into words, that the time would
come when they would grow weary of their efforts and be glad to
yield and come to her for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my home is still open to you,&rdquo; she said as
she took her departure. &ldquo;Though you defy my authority and
persist in your headstrong course, I shall never forget that you
are my brother&rsquo;s children. The time will come when you will
remember this. Mark my words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be too dreadful if we did have to go
to her for help, after all?&rdquo; said Honor, as the train moved
away. The three older girls had accompanied their aunt to the
little station. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she simply shriek at us,
&lsquo;I told you so!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never have the chance if I can prevent
it,&rdquo; returned Katherine. &ldquo;Rather than go to Aunt
Sophia for help after all that has been said this afternoon I
would rather&mdash;I would rather scrub floors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Which
was Katherine&rsquo;s favorite simile for the extreme of hard
work, although the wildest flights of the imagination could
scarcely picture her in such an employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never give Aunt Sophia any such satisfaction as
that,&rdquo; she added, with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly astonished that she gave in at
last,&rdquo; remarked Victoria, as the three walked arm in arm
across the lawn. &ldquo;I really thought she would stick it out
to the very end, and perhaps refuse to have anything more to do
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;Do you
know I think it is almost a relief to Aunt Sophia that she
isn&rsquo;t obliged to have us there, after all. We should
interfere dreadfully with her regular ways, even if she did turn
us to account, with her writing and her dusting, and I also think
she is very curious to see what we do, and how we come out. She
is already looking forward, I plainly see, to the time, when she
can prove that she knows more than anybody else, and that we are
all dismal failures. For that reason, girls, if for nothing else,
we must prove that we are not. We <i>must</i> succeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Do you think we were at all disrespectful to
her?&rdquo; said Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a bit. We had to be emphatic. It was the only
way to make her understand that we were in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but she is father&rsquo;s sister and our only
near relative, even if she is aggravating, and I think she is
fond of us in her own way. It was very good and generous of her
to offer to do so much for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly in &lsquo;her own way&rsquo; that she
loves us, if she loves us at all,&rdquo; said Katherine.
&ldquo;Honor, it must be a terrible bore to have such a
conscience as you are burdened with. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s
yours, and not mine, and I&rsquo;m glad, too, that we came out
victorious in the scrimmage with our beloved aunt, fond of us
though she may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the end of the week, their plans were made, and they were
ready to put them at once into action. The idea of a
boarding-school was abandoned. That was absolutely impracticable,
as they soon saw for themselves. They had no experience upon
which to go to work, and no influence upon which they could
depend to bring them pupils.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Honor,
however, opened a day school for small children. There happened
to be none already in Fordham, and among the friends of the
Starrs there were a number who were glad, not only to help the
girls in their efforts for self-support, but also to have a class
formed for the children whom it was not desirable, because of
their extreme youth, to send to the larger schools.</p>
<p>Katherine had already secured several music scholars and hoped
for more, while she also intended to help Honor with the school,
in which Sophy was to be a pupil. Victoria and Peter left the
private schools which they had attended and were transferred to
public ones, although Victoria secretly determined that this
should be her last winter of study. She felt that she must unite
with the others in working for the support of the family. Had not
she been the one who had first suggested the idea? In the
meantime she planted her violet bed and proceeded to investigate
the cultivation of mushrooms.</p>
<p>The house servants were all informed that they must go, and a
new &ldquo;maid of all work&rdquo; was engaged, who was expected
to perform wonders in the kitchen and elsewhere. The gardener and
the <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>coachman were also dismissed, and the horses and cows
were sold. The girls had concluded that it would be unwise at
present to attempt to make butter, for with their many other
duties it would be impossible to attend to it. A man who lived
near could be called upon to come occasionally if one were needed
upon the place, and when spring approached they could engage some
one regularly, if they decided to raise vegetables for sale.</p>
<p>At present their chief thought was the school. A room on the
second floor was to be used for the purpose, the bedstead and
bureau removed, and some desks, which Katherine went to Boston to
buy, were to be placed there in readiness for the pupils. There
had been some discussion about the purchase of these desks,
Victoria suggesting that tables would do for the present, until
they should have a little more ready money, and should also be
able to see whether the number of scholars would warrant such an
outlay.</p>
<p>But Katherine was strongly of the opinion that desks would add
greatly to the professional appearance of the room, and would
have, in consequence, a beneficial effect upon the children, and
as Honor agreed with her in this, she went off triumphantly <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>to Boston
with the money in her pocket with which she was to pay for them.
Neither Honor nor Victoria was able to go with her, but she
professed herself quite equal to the task of choosing the
necessary articles without her sisters&rsquo; help.</p>
<p>When she returned she announced to them that she had bought
not only six small desks with chairs to match, but also a larger
desk for Honor, a map of the world to hang upon the wall, and a
blackboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it is really important to have all these
things,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;A schoolroom without a map would
be like bread without butter, and this is the cheapest and the
most complete thing you ever saw. The United States on one side,
and the whole world on the other, and only a dollar. And you
needn&rsquo;t shake your head over the desk for Honor, Victoria!
Of course she ought to have a desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid our bread will soon be without butter
if you go on in this way,&rdquo; remarked Victoria. &ldquo;Honor
could have used a table with a drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that wouldn&rsquo;t do at all!&rdquo; said
Katherine, impatiently. &ldquo;You have such scrimpy ideas, Vic;
I don&rsquo;t see where you get them. And besides, I <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>did a stroke
of business. They allowed me a discount of ten per cent at the
furniture store because I was a professional, so it really paid
to get all those things. It is great fun to be a professional. I
get music cheaper at the music stores, just because I give
lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you have enough money for so many
things?&rdquo; asked the practical younger sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t paid for them yet,&rdquo; rejoined
Katherine, easily. &ldquo;They asked me if I would have them
charged, and I said yes. I really thought it would be better to
have a bill for them, and there may be more ready money when it
comes in, and besides, I needed that money for something
else&mdash;something that is to be a grand surprise for you all
and is to help us make our fortunes. It is coming out by express
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine, what have you been getting?&rdquo; exclaimed
Honor and Victoria together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just wait!&rdquo; cried Katherine, gaily, as she
left them and went to her room to take off her hat and coat.
&ldquo;I tell you, it is to be a grand surprise. It is coming
with the desks and chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it is?&rdquo; asked Honor.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;I am afraid to think,&rdquo; returned Victoria,
&ldquo;and I think it was a great pity she had those things
charged. Perhaps we shan&rsquo;t have any money at all when the
bill comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid, child! Katherine is
extravagant, I must confess, but we have six pupils promised, you
know, for the school, and she has eight music scholars. We shall
be all right, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of these reassuring words Honor felt as uneasy as
did Victoria about Katherine&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the new maid?&rdquo; asked
Victoria, presently. The sisters were in Honor&rsquo;s room,
darning the family stockings by the waning light of the short
November day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; replied Honor,
running her long needle in and out as she crossed and re-crossed
a large hole. &ldquo;I suppose Peter wears out his stockings so
quickly because he is such a tramper, but this one is
discouraging. Do you think it is worth while to spend our
precious time over such a hole as this, Vic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the stocking would stand a little more
wear,&rdquo; said Vic, laying down her own work and <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>examining
critically that of her sister. &ldquo;I like a good big hole if I
am going to darn at all. Running over thin places bores me to
death. It is just like life. A big hole is like a big calamity;
you can rise above it. But the little botherations are like the
thin places. You have got to go over them and patch them up, or
else they will go altogether, and yet there is really nothing to
show for it in the end, and the doing it tires you out. With a
big hole or a big trouble you know just where you are and how you
stand. But tell me what you think of the new maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid she is like the thin places in the
stockings,&rdquo; said Honor, laughing as she made the
comparison. &ldquo;She requires a great deal of attention, and I
don&rsquo;t know where she is going to burst out next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the queerest part of her. She told me it was
&lsquo;B.&rsquo; Lafferty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bee?&rdquo; repeated Victoria. &ldquo;What a curious
name! Do you suppose it is short for Beatrice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. It is the letter B, and it really stands
for Bridget, but she told me she never liked the name of Bridget
and didn&rsquo;t wish to be called <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that. I told her I thought I should,
upon which she said she should take the next train back to Boston
if we did. Her friends called her &lsquo;B.,&rsquo; and we must
call her &lsquo;B.,&rsquo; or if not &lsquo;B.&rsquo; it could be
&lsquo;Blanch.&rsquo; On the whole, she preferred Blanch, so I
suppose it has got to be that, though I can&rsquo;t imagine
anything more inappropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be thankful she didn&rsquo;t request us to call
her &lsquo;Miss Lafferty,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Victoria.
&ldquo;I think she is going to be amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Honor, somewhat grimly.
&ldquo;To me at present it seems more tragic than amusing. She
won&rsquo;t have late dinner, for one thing. We have got to dine
in the middle of the day after to-night. It really seems as if
she meant to rule us, but I shan&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family were engaged in eating the last dinner which they
were to be allowed to enjoy in the evening when the Fordham and
Boston express wagon was heard coming down the Glen Arden avenue,
and shortly afterwards the door which led into the front hall
from the kitchen department was flung open by B. Lafferty, who
announced as she did so that &ldquo;a whole lot of furniters had
come, and what was she to be afther doin&rsquo; wid
&rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;Bring them right in here, please,&rdquo; said
Honor. &ldquo;Peter, won&rsquo;t you go and help? We shall have
to do a good deal ourselves, I suppose, now that we have only one
girl,&rdquo; she added, as Blanch&rsquo;s heavy tread echoed in
the distance, and Peter, who had heard of Katherine&rsquo;s
shopping expedition and was possessed of a lively curiosity, went
willingly enough to investigate the result.</p>
<p>The chairs, desks, blackboard, and map had all been brought
in, also a globe and a package containing chalk, pencils,
copy-books, blank-books, and school stationery of all kinds,
which Katherine had forgotten to mention, and then Peter
appeared, staggering beneath the weight of a square box. It
seemed to be heavy, and he set it down with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I suppose that is your
surprise, Katherine. It weighs a ton, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Oh,
girls, I wonder what you will say when you see it! But look at
the desks before we open it. Aren&rsquo;t they too sweet for
anything? And so cheap, too. I forgot to tell you I got a globe.
You know a schoolroom is nothing without a globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;But the surprise,&rdquo; interposed Sophy.
&ldquo;Do show it to us quick, Kathie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to make you all guess,&rdquo;
said Katherine, mischievously. She glanced from one to the other
as she spoke. It almost seemed as if she were afraid to let them
see it, Victoria thought, though she had assumed this air of
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we can&rsquo;t stop to guess,&rdquo; said they,
and Peter had already begun to remove the lid of the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eye!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Oh, my two eyes,
what do I see? Katherine&rsquo;s been and gone and done it this
time!&rdquo; And he burst into shouts of derisive laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; cried the others, as they
crowded about and pushed the desks and chairs out of the way, in
their haste to see the contents of the mysterious box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a typewriter,&rdquo; announced Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A typewriter</i>!&rdquo; repeated her sisters.
&ldquo;What&mdash;what for? Why did you buy a
typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you stupid children, to typewrite with, of
course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; certainly not. How should I? But I am <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>going to
learn. It was a tremendous bargain, and I have been thinking of
them for some time without saying anything about it. You know the
magazines are full of advertisements of them, and they have made
me simply wild to have one. I thought it would be so useful for
us to have one in the house, and we can make a lot of money with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Honor.</p>
<p>Something in her voice made Katherine glance at her
sister&rsquo;s face; but Honor was standing in the shadow cast by
the staircase, which went up from the centre of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing typewriting for people, of course. You hear all
the time of girls who are typewriters. How dull of comprehension
you are to-night, Honor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you give for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, it was awfully cheap! The man assured me it
was a wonderful bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They usually do,&rdquo; remarked Honor, &ldquo;but you
haven&rsquo;t yet named the price. How much was it,
Katherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really a hundred-dollar machine, but they call it
second-hand, though it has only been used a little, and so I got
it for forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;Forty dollars!&rdquo; cried Victoria, while
Honor&rsquo;s feelings prevented her for the moment from finding
words, and Peter gave utterance to a prolonged whistle of
astonishment. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean, Katherine, that you
have actually spent forty dollars on <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Katherine, with an assumption of
boldness that she was far from feeling. &ldquo;Only forty
dollars. I assure you it is the cheapest thing I ever saw. I
never dreamed of being able to get a decent one for less than
fifty at the lowest&mdash;and when we are making money with it,
you will thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>how</i> are we to make money with it?&rdquo;
asked Victoria, while Peter laughed with malicious glee. He had
been so often remonstrated with himself for various misdemeanors
that he was glad to see his chief critic undergoing the same
unpleasant experience. &ldquo;Do you know how to use
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet; but that is easily learned. The man
offered to give me a lesson, but I was in a hurry, and so he said
I could come in any time. He showed me some books on the subject,
which I bought, and I can easily puzzle it out myself, I think.
It will be something to do in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Have you paid for it, or did you have it charged,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Honor who asked the question. She had not spoken for
some time, and her voice had the same note which Katherine, who
was susceptible to voices, had remarked upon before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I paid for it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That is what
I wanted the ready money for. I saw it in the window of a
typewriter place as I was on my way to the furniture store. I
knew I should have to pay &lsquo;cash down&rsquo; for it, as they
didn&rsquo;t know me there, while they did at the furniture
place. I hope you think I did right, girls. I hope you agree with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Honor, turning slowly and looking
at her sister,&mdash;&ldquo;I think you are the most foolish and
the most extravagant person I ever saw or heard of. The idea of
your spending forty dollars on a typewriter, when we are so poor
we can scarcely buy our food, and it was just as much as we could
do to scrape the forty dollars together for you to take to Boston
to buy the schoolroom furniture with. Oh, that we had never let
you go! Can the thing be taken back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Katherine, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;Why of course it can&rsquo;t, Honor, unless in
exchange for another typewriter! Of course the man isn&rsquo;t
going to give me back the money. How foolish you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolishness must run in the family,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;I think Aunt Sophia was quite right when she said we were
nothing but children and not fit to take care of ourselves. If
you go on in this way, we shall soon have to take refuge in
Beacon Street, after all. I think you might at least have
consulted us before you bought it. I suppose you were afraid to.
That is the reason you were so anxious to go yourself to buy the
desks. You had made up your mind before you went, to get this
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t at all, Honor,&rdquo; cried Katherine,
stung by this accusation. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of
doing it until I saw them in the window. If I had happened to go
through any other street, I should never have dreamed of getting
it. It was evidently intended that we should own a typewriter,
for I was led right up to the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An easy sort of philosophy,&rdquo; remarked Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; interposed Victoria, &ldquo;it is done,
so there is no use in lamenting. We may as well <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>make the best
of it, though the next time you go to Boston, Katherine, I think
Honor and I had better be on each side of you to keep you from
being &lsquo;led up&rsquo; to windows. If you had been
&lsquo;led&rsquo; to Toppan&rsquo;s window, would you have bought
all that you saw there? Or to Shreve&rsquo;s, or Bigelow&rsquo;s?
Oh, Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Victoria, who had been undecided for some time as to
whether she should laugh or cry, began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is too funny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
feel as if we had a white elephant in the house. In addition to
everything else that we have to do we have all got to learn
typewriting, so as to make it pay! Oh, Katherine,
Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor hesitated a moment. The situation was amusing, and
Victoria&rsquo;s mirth was contagious, but she felt very angry.
Then seeing that Katherine was looking troubled, she decided that
she too had better try to laugh it off. After all, it was very
funny. And presently they were all laughing so uproariously, that
B. Lafferty again opened the door and peeped in at them,
wondering what amusing article had come by express.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, Katherine became sober.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that after
all I was wise to get it. When the money begins to pour in from
it, you will see what a brilliant idea it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how it is going to pour in,
unless you are going to manufacture bank notes with it,&rdquo;
remarked Honor; &ldquo;but we will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went back to their forgotten dinner, and after it was
finished, they proceeded to arrange the schoolroom. It was again
Saturday, and school was to open the following Monday.</p>
<p>Katherine slipped away before long, her absence being at first
unnoticed by the others. Presently Peter also disappeared from
the room, but he soon returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see something rich,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;come look over the banisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As has been said, the stairway ascended from the centre of the
large square hall. It was very broad, and a gallery ran around
the second story, upon which opened the doors of the bedrooms. By
leaning over the railing which guarded this gallery, the girls
and Peter could see Katherine, who sat in the hall below. She was
at work upon the typewriter, the &ldquo;clickety-click&rdquo; of
the keys <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>coming at long intervals, while she studied the book of
instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lightning writer!&rdquo; whispered Peter.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you could write with a pen as fast as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Victoria; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let her
hear you. But, oh, Honor, we shall have to work extra hard to
make up for Katherine&rsquo;s extravagance! What <i>shall</i> we
do with her?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PETER SEEKS INFORMATION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Peter</span> is in one of his
moods. He won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So announced Sophy, returning from the barn for the third time
one day towards the end of the following week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we want him, Sophy. Did you tell him so?&rdquo;
asked Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the reason he won&rsquo;t come. When I
said, &lsquo;They want you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Let &rsquo;em
want. I&rsquo;ve got something else to do than be tied to
Honor&rsquo;s apron strings.&rsquo; What did he mean, Honor? You
hardly ever wear an apron, and I never saw you tie
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine, who was also present, laughed, as she invariably
did when Sophy made a remark of this kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the most literal young one I ever saw,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Did you really suppose, now,
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; interposed Honor, who saw that
Sophy, always easily moved to tears by Katherine&rsquo;s
criticisms, looked ready to cry. &ldquo;He means by that that he
doesn&rsquo;t want to do things for us. Very disobliging of him,
I think. What is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting on the fence just outside of the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I wish he would come! Well, Katherine, we
shall have to do it ourselves. A boy can be so useful, and it
does seem provoking to have one right in the family and not be
able to turn him to account. I will hold the step-ladder while
you go up. Isn&rsquo;t it horrid to have to do all this
ourselves? I do miss the servants dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were hanging the parlor curtains for the first time
in their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to look horribly, too,&rdquo; said
Katherine. &ldquo;I really think it would pay, Honor, to have a
man come up from Fordham and do it. It wouldn&rsquo;t cost
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would cost more than we have got at present,&rdquo;
replied Honor. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she added a little drearily
after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to learn
to do these things ourselves. Other people <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>do, and there
is no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t. Be careful, Katherine.
You&rsquo;re putting that ever so much higher on the right than
you did on the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Sophy returned once more to the barn. She
found that Peter had not moved from his position upon the fence,
and as far as she could judge he was still in &ldquo;one of his
moods.&rdquo; When he saw Sophy approaching for the fourth time,
he fixed his gaze yet more intently upon the river, which gleamed
beyond the tall pine trees in the grove.</p>
<p>Sophy was a small and slenderly built child of eight. The fact
that she was so much younger than her sisters had perhaps caused
her to be considered the baby of the family longer than would
otherwise have been the case. She was not a pretty child, for her
eyes were too large and staring for the small thin face, and the
temporary absence of two of her front teeth gave her a grotesque
expression. Her hair, which was straight, had been cut short for
the sake of convenience, and her cheeks were pale for those of a
country child.</p>
<p>Sophy adored her only brother with all the ardor <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of her
childish heart. She considered him the tallest, the strongest,
and the handsomest boy in all the town of Fordham, or Boston
either, for that matter, and she was his willing slave at all
times&mdash;a state of affairs which Peter was not slow to
recognize and of which he availed himself on every possible
occasion.</p>
<p>When Peter was &ldquo;in one of his moods&rdquo; he was to
Sophy more fascinating than ever. She hung near him, wondering
what was the matter, what troublesome thoughts were thronging his
brain, and whether it would be possible to offer him any help.
She longed to comfort him on these occasions, but never knew how
to do it.</p>
<p>This afternoon she seated herself upon a convenient rock and
leaned her chin upon her hand, her great brown eyes fastened upon
her brother, who was perched upon the fence rail. Peter at first
paid no attention to her presence. Then he stirred uneasily. He
turned and looked at her, and then looked quickly away again. The
stare of those big brown eyes was so unflinching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go away,&rdquo; said he at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Sophy.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m thinking, and&mdash;and
you&rsquo;re such a stare-cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t any longer,&rdquo; returned the obliging
Sophy, and fixed her eyes at once upon the ground, only now and
then raising them for a furtive glance at the motionless figure
upon the fence. The mood was lasting a long time, she
thought.</p>
<p>It was a mild day in November, and the purple haze in the
atmosphere proved that it was Indian summer. There was a
delicious smell of autumn in the air, and the smoke of burning
brush was borne to them from the distance. One could hear sounds
that seemed to come from far away, and in the pasture which lay
to the right of the pine grove, a vast number of crows had
alighted. Presently, having finished their conference, they rose
with one accord and soared far above the tops of the tallest pine
trees, cawing to one another as they went. Peter glanced up at
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a crow,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Sophy gave a little sigh of relief. He had spoken; he was
coming out of his mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because&mdash;&rdquo; And then he stopped. <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Sophy sighed
again, this time with disappointment. He was not going to tell
her! Presently, he again broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were anything,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;anything
but what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish you were a girl?&rdquo; asked his little
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter; &ldquo;of course not a
<i>girl</i>! But anything else. A bird, a beetle, a squirrel.
Something alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was difficult philosophy for Sophy to comprehend. Would
the life of a beetle, or even of a bird, be preferable to that of
a girl? And was not a girl &ldquo;alive&rdquo;? She was about to
inquire further, when her brother spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just
tired of it! I&rsquo;m not going to stand it any longer.
I&rsquo;m going to run away to sea. But if I disappear, Sophy,
don&rsquo;t you tell them where I&rsquo;ve gone. Don&rsquo;t tell
the girls that I ever said anything about running away to sea;
now mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sophy, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, but I hope
you won&rsquo;t decide to go, Peter. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit
nice without you. Why do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Peter, leaping to the

and seating himself upon a rock. The fence rail had ceased to be
comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing for me to do. We are all poor, and the
girls have to work, and I can&rsquo;t do a thing. If I were as
old as Honor, I could go into business right away, and make a
fortune, and support you all. I&rsquo;m the only boy in the
family, and I ought to be the one to do it. I don&rsquo;t see why
I wasn&rsquo;t the oldest instead of having three girls older
than me to order me around. It just makes me mad. Why, if I had
only been the oldest, I&rsquo;d be finishing college now, and
going into a law office, or I&rsquo;d be a doctor and have lots
of patients, or I&rsquo;d go into business; stocks, or a bank, or
something or other. Instead of that I&rsquo;ve got to knock round
here and fuss over little things the girls want me to do, and go
to that hateful Hastings School down at Fordham. But what&rsquo;s
the use of talking to you? You don&rsquo;t understand.
You&rsquo;re nothing but a girl, and a baby one at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy&rsquo;s great brown eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a girl,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I
wish I wasn&rsquo;t, Peter. Indeed I do! I wish you&rsquo;d
please excuse me for being one, for I can&rsquo;t really help it,
but&mdash;but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m such a
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what you are, then,&rdquo;
said her brother, crossly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying now. That
proves that you&rsquo;re a baby. Do you suppose a boy would cry
as easily as you do, or any one who wasn&rsquo;t a
baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; cried a gay voice, as
the rustle of dead leaves on the pasture path was heard, and
Victoria came into sight. &ldquo;I heard you ever so far off, and
it sounded exactly as if you were scolding, Peter. I got off the
train at Waterview and walked up, as I missed the one that
connected. I&rsquo;ve been thinking over something, and I want
your advice, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw at a glance that Sophy had been made unhappy, but she
thought it wiser to pass it over unnoticed for the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked her brother, interested in
spite of himself. Then he added hastily: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re
only making that up to change the subject. You don&rsquo;t really
want my advice. You think I&rsquo;m scolding Sophy, and so I am.
Why, she cries if you say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want your advice,&rdquo; interrupted Victoria;
&ldquo;and if you can&rsquo;t give it to me, I shall have to ask
some other boy or man. It is about <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>mushrooms. Do you know anything at
all about them, and do you think it would pay to raise them? I
have been reading up about them to-day in the Encyclop&aelig;dia
at school. That was the reason I missed the other train. It seems
as if we could make some money out of them if we only tried. It
says in the Encyclop&aelig;dia that the cultivated ones
don&rsquo;t taste as good as the wild ones, but there must be a
demand for them, for people use them when the others are out of
season. I was wondering whether you would want to undertake
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean me alone?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see I have the violets to attend to, and lots
of things in the house. We have so much dusting and all that sort
of thing to do, now that we have only one maid, and with all I
have to study, I really don&rsquo;t think I can undertake
anything more. Couldn&rsquo;t you read up about them, and find
out all you can? You might make a good deal that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleam of something like interest had come into Peter&rsquo;s
hitherto depressed-looking face. It quickly faded, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a little thing,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;Little? How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t really amount to anything. What
is raising mushrooms? Anybody could do that. I want to do
something big. If I were only a man, now, I could support you
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you could,&rdquo; rejoined Victoria,
quickly, &ldquo;and it would be too lovely for anything; but you
will be a man some day, Peter, and then you can do it, and in the
meantime it seems as if the little things would count. And
mushrooms are not so little, either. I mean the raising of them.
You <i>might</i> be able to make a good deal that way, and in
other gardening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d call me a mushroom, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Peter, gloomily, after he had reviewed the situation for a few
moments in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mushroom, or perhaps a toadstool. More likely a
toadstool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! Who would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Hastings school-boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would they? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are hateful,&rdquo; said Peter, rising and
walking about with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;The class I
am in is nothing but a <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>set of ruffians. I&rsquo;d like to
fight &rsquo;em, every one of &rsquo;em, and I will some day.
They call me the &lsquo;Glen Arden dude&rsquo; now. You see
I&rsquo;m the only boy there who has been to a private school. I
wish father had never sent me to that school in Boston. I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said Victoria, quickly.
&ldquo;Father always did what was quite right. What else do they
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m tied to my sisters&rsquo; apron
strings, just because they saw me with Honor and Katherine
yesterday when I was carrying the bundles. I&rsquo;ll never go to
Fordham with any of you girls again, and I&rsquo;m not going to
carry your bundles if I do go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly a look of scorn gathered in Victoria&rsquo;s
expressive face. Her brown eyes fairly gleamed with it as they
regarded her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a poor-spirited boy you must be, Peter!&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor-spirited!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;m willing to fight any boy or any two boys in that
school, and I will yet. I&rsquo;d like to know what you mean by
that, Vic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that you are not brave <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>enough if
there is any fighting to be done,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d trust you quickly enough for that, but I think
you are very poor-spirited to be afraid to carry our bundles or
be seen with any of us, just because those common boys that go to
the Hastings School in Fordham chose to laugh at you for doing
it. If you go on in this way, you won&rsquo;t be the kind of man
father was, or that Mr. Abbott is. Mr. Abbott is only too glad to
do things for women, and father was just like him in that. And if
you are not willing to do these little things for us now, I
don&rsquo;t believe you will take care of us when you grow up, so
we may as well get accustomed to taking care of
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s face flushed. He recognized the truth of
Victoria&rsquo;s remarks, although he had no intention of
acknowledging it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d
stop! There is no one else in the world that I&rsquo;d let say
those things to me. If you were a fellow, I&rsquo;d knock you
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Victoria,
laughing good-humoredly, &ldquo;for the very good reason that I
should be engaged in knocking you down! You think over that
mushroom plan, Peter,&rdquo; she <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>continued, as she rose from the rock
upon which she had been sitting. &ldquo;I must go into the house
now and see what there is to be done. Come along, Sophy, and tell
me how school went to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters walked away together, leaving Peter to ruminate
over Victoria&rsquo;s remarks. He looked after them for a moment
and then himself departed. He had suddenly determined to go to a
certain florist who owned some large greenhouses in Fordham, and
consult with him as to the best method of raising mushrooms.
Perhaps it could be kept a secret from the boys at school. At any
rate, the subject was worth considering.</p>
<p>He walked over to the village and took an electric car, which
carried him in a short time almost to his destination, although
it was a distance of some miles. Upon leaving the car, he had a
walk of several blocks, and his way was through the most crowded
street of Fordham,&mdash;the main street, in fact, upon which
were most of the shops, and which at this hour of the afternoon,
when the trains arrived at short intervals from Boston, was well
filled with people.</p>
<p>Peter walked along, paying little attention to the passers-by,
as his mind reviewed the late <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>conversation with Victoria, when he
was attracted by some squirrels in a cage. The cage was standing
upon a barrel outside of a provision store. The store was on a
corner, and the squirrels were on the side street, which was a
small one.</p>
<p>They were skipping about in the revolving cage, engaged in an
ever-failing attempt to make progress, and compelled to pursue
their ceaseless round of futile activity. Peter, as he watched
them, wished that he could set them free. He wondered how much
the provision dealer would sell them for. Then he remembered that
there was little enough money to spare, and none with which to
free squirrels.</p>
<p>For a wonder, no one else was watching the little animals.
When they had first been placed there, a small crowd had gathered
daily to look at their antics; but the Fordham youth had grown
accustomed to them now, and Peter was the only one who stopped.
Presently, however, another boy sauntered up, and stood a little
beyond Peter. He was very shabbily dressed, and Peter, who was
observant, noticed that he looked hungry. Instead of watching the
squirrels, he found himself watching the boy, who was quite
unconscious of it.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Presently the boy put out his hand and quietly
abstracted an apple from a barrel that was standing there, and
dropped it into his pocket. In a moment he repeated the
operation. Then he moved slightly, and his gaze encountered
Peter&rsquo;s. Instantly his fist doubled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to tell on me, I&rsquo;ll knock
you down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell on you, though I&rsquo;m
not afraid of your knocking me down,&rdquo; returned Peter.
&ldquo;But what are you doing it for? It seems to me it&rsquo;s a
pretty mean thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d do it if you was as hungry as
me,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I mean to take
another&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t nobody looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Peter.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any money to pay for
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money! I ain&rsquo;t seen a nickel for a week, and I
ain&rsquo;t had nothin&rsquo; to eat since yesterday
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter put his hand in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got much myself,&rdquo; said he,
pulling out a dime, a five-cent piece, and some pennies, which he
placed in the palm of one hand while he searched the depths of
his pockets with the other. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got much
money ourselves, nowadays, but <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>we&rsquo;ve got enough to eat. It
must be pretty bad to be hungry. I&rsquo;ve got to keep five
cents to get back to Fordham Falls, but I&rsquo;d be glad if
you&rsquo;d take the rest, and I wish you&rsquo;d go in and pay
for those apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed the money upon the top of the barrel which held the
squirrels&rsquo; cage, and walked quickly away. The boy looked
after him in astonishment. Then he took the money and went into
the store with the apples which he had appropriated in his hand.
He paid for them, and also for a loaf of bread, and then he
hurried up the main street in the direction in which Peter had
walked. He could not overtake him, however, and when he had
reached the less thickly populated part of the town and still saw
nothing of his benefactor, he turned aside into a narrow road,
and sitting down, he began to devour the bread and apples, from
time to time looking, as he ate, at the eight cents which
remained of what Peter had given him. He felt like a
millionaire.</p>
<p>In the meantime Peter went to the florist&rsquo;s, and
fortunately finding him at home, proceeded to question him
closely on the subject for which he had come. After spending a
half-hour in interesting conversation he left the place, and as
it was yet too <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>early for his car back to Fordham Falls, he took a
roundabout way for the sake of using up his superfluous time.</p>
<p>As he walked he thought he heard the cry of an animal in pain.
Peter was passionately fond of living creatures, be they insects,
birds, or beasts, and the sound that he heard was undoubtedly the
yelp of a suffering dog. He ran in the direction from which it
proceeded, and very soon, upon turning a corner in the road, came
upon two boys who were engaged in torturing a dog which they had
tied to the fence rail.</p>
<p>Before they knew what had happened, one boy was rolling in the
ditch by the side of the road, and the other was being pommelled
and shaken by an infuriated person, who had apparently sprung out
of the ground, so unexpectedly had his presence become known to
them.</p>
<p>At first the surprise completely paralyzed the boys, one of
whom was larger than Peter, the other smaller; but they soon
recovered themselves, and it would undoubtedly have gone hard
with the aggressor had he not been suddenly reinforced by help
from the most unlooked-for quarter.</p>
<p>The boy whom Peter had met in front of the <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>provision
store, had been eating his bread and apples not far from the
scene of the fight. Hearing the sound of a scuffle, he ran down
the road, and saw at once that his late benefactor was evidently
getting the worst of it. Gratitude, added to the food which Peter
had given him, gave strength to the newcomer, and in a few
moments the victory was won.</p>
<p>The two young ruffians were prostrate in the road, and Peter
walked away with the injured dog in his arms, accompanied by his
new friend.</p>
<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PETER&rsquo;S NEW
ACQUAINTANCES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Victoria and Sophy reached the
house after their conversation with Peter, they found Honor and
Katherine still struggling with the parlor curtains. Two windows
were finished, and Katherine was in the act of mounting the
step-ladder at the third, when her younger sisters appeared. At
the same moment Blanch thrust her head in the doorway at the back
of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell yers,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there
ain&rsquo;t no bread in the house for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Blanch!&rdquo; cried Honor, turning to look at her,
while she steadied the ladder. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
me before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it. I thought yers&rsquo;d know it
yerselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we know it? I can&rsquo;t spend all my time
looking into the bread-box, and I had no idea the last baking
would have given out so soon. You will have to make some biscuits
or some corn bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never made any. Of course I know
how to make &rsquo;em, but as I ain&rsquo;t never made any, yers
mightn&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Honor, with as much majesty
of demeanor as she could assume when embracing a step-ladder.
&ldquo;I will show you how presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Honor was not as tall as Katherine, and was very
slight, she could be extremely dignified when she chose.</p>
<p>Blanch&rsquo;s head disappeared, and the door closed with a
bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Honor, do you know how yourself?&rdquo; asked
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t the least idea, but I&rsquo;m not
going to tell her so. I will look it up in the recipe book. It is
a curious thing about B. Lafferty. She never will acknowledge
that she can&rsquo;t do a thing. She is the most conceited
person, as well as the most aggravating, that I ever
met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine at the top of the ladder laughed as she adjusted the
curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be taking lessons from her,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;telling her that you would show her how to make biscuits.
I wonder what they will be like! <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>It is bad enough to have had to give
up dining late to suit Miss B. Lafferty&rsquo;s fancies, without
having to go without bread for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take my place at the ladder, Vic,&rdquo; said
Honor, with the air of one who had determined to defy fate,
&ldquo;and I will find the recipe book and <i>make the
biscuits</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did school go to-day?&rdquo; asked Victoria, when
Honor had left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, beautifully! Minnie Chase pinched Bertha Hickens,
which naturally had the effect of making Bertha howl loudly, and
that frightened Carry Deane so badly that she began to cry, which
so affected Tommy Deane that he began to cry, and presently the
whole school was weeping and in an uproar. Lessons had to be
stopped for at least twenty minutes while Honor and I wiped eyes
and patted shoulders and scolded Minnie for being the cause of it
all. Oh, it went beautifully! Another tack please, Vic, and a
good big one. There, that is the last! Dear me,&rdquo; continued
Katherine, standing in the middle of the room and looking about
her, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t look as they ought to, but I
can&rsquo;t help it! Honor won&rsquo;t have the man from Fordham,
so we shall have to go with crooked curtains. <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>I must rush
now, for I have a music lesson to give. I would so much rather
stay at home and practise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor had been wrestling with her recipe books and her
biscuits for more than an hour, Katherine had given her music
lesson and returned, and Victoria, aided by Sophy,&mdash;who was
perhaps more of a hindrance than a help, but whom it pleased to
be called into service,&mdash;had performed various household
duties, and still Peter did not come back.</p>
<p>It was no unusual matter for him to be off in the woods and
meadows for hours at a time, and therefore his sisters were not
in the least alarmed by his absence, especially as Victoria
suspected that he had acted upon her suggestion and had gone to
consult the Fordham florist.</p>
<p>When the clock struck six, however, and he had not yet come,
they began to wonder as to his whereabouts, and Sophy went to one
of the second-story windows and took up her station there. The
sun had set, but a young moon was shining brightly, and she could
see plainly the beautiful lawn, dotted with the fine old trees
now quite bare of leaves, across which Peter might be expected to
come if he had gone to Fordham by the electric car, as Victoria
supposed.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Sophy
watched for some time in silence, but at last her scrutiny was
rewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and he is
carrying something, and there&rsquo;s somebody with him! Who do
you s&rsquo;pose it is? It is a boy, and he looks raggedy, and
it&rsquo;s a dog! I really think it&rsquo;s a truly dog! Vic,
where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy, in great excitement, ran from her post of observation
and hurried down the stairs. The front door was thrown open, and
Peter entered, tenderly carrying a good-sized yellow dog, whose
leg was bound up and whose head lay limply upon his arm, and
accompanied by a boy who, as Sophy had said, was
&ldquo;raggedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four sisters gathered from different parts of the house
and surveyed the newcomers, surprise mingled with disapprobation
being unmistakably depicted on the countenances of all, with the
exception, perhaps, of Sophy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some witch hazel,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;and
some kind of an ointment or something. Vic, get it for me, will
you? This dog&rsquo;s leg is broken, and he has a lot of wounds.
This is Dave Carney. He&rsquo;s going to stay to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; said four voices.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look exactly as if you had been in a
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter! But are you&mdash;are you going to fix the
dog&rsquo;s leg here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take him down to the barn, if you like.
I suppose you will all make a terrible fuss, if I don&rsquo;t.
Isn&rsquo;t he a nice dog? Some fellows were hurting him, but we
floored &rsquo;em, Carney and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carney, in the meantime, had retired to the least conspicuous
position that he could find. He stood far back by the door, and
he twirled his shabby cap in his hand, looking the while as
though he would prefer to be in any place but that in which he
found himself.</p>
<p>Honor and Victoria, who were on the broad staircase, turned
towards one another. Honor&rsquo;s pretty eyebrows were drawn
together in a frown, and her face said as plainly as though she
had spoken, &ldquo;What are we to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get the witch hazel,&rdquo; said Victoria,
aloud, &ldquo;and will bring it down to the barn. You
and&mdash;and your friend had better take the dog down there now,
Peter, and make a bed for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Bring some old rags,&rdquo; commanded Peter,
&ldquo;and something nice and soft for him to lie on. This would
do,&rdquo; he added, picking up a white chudda shawl which hung
over the back of one of the hall chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best white shawl!&rdquo; cried Katherine, springing
forward just in time to rescue it before it was wrapped about the
suffering animal. &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Peter? Do take
that dirty dog out of the house! I never saw such a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria, as she hurried up the stairs, sighed to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I am afraid
Katherine will say just the wrong thing, and before we know it
Peter will insist upon keeping the dog in the house, and having
the boy at the supper-table. Where did he pick them
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter, whatever may have been his first impulse, decided
that, after all, it would be the wiser course to repair to the
barn, and here Victoria found him with his new friend, when she
and Sophy followed with the remedies.</p>
<p>The dog was, without doubt, very much hurt; but he seemed to
appreciate all that was being done for him, and he looked
lovingly at Peter as he bathed his wounds and bound up his
leg.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;How would you like to have your supper out here,
Peter?&rdquo; said Victoria, who had been pondering the
situation. &ldquo;Then you could stay near the dog and see that
he is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Peter, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know but it would be a good plan. What do you say,
Carney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carney was too bashful to speak.</p>
<p>It was a happy solution of the difficulty, and Victoria and
Sophy hurried back to the house, and had soon packed a basket for
the picnic in the barn. Honor&rsquo;s biscuits, made so early in
the afternoon, had risen and fallen again long since, and were
now little lumps of hard and sodden dough; but the sisters
thought that the boys would doubtless enjoy them, and they
bestowed them with a generous hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can eat crackers ourselves,&rdquo; said Katherine.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings, Honor,
but&mdash;but&mdash;<i>do</i> look in the bread-box to-morrow,
please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor had seated herself in her place at the head of the
table. The old silver service and the delicate cups and saucers
gleamed in the light which fell from the candles. The table was
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>covered
with a cloth of the finest damask, a silver
<i>jardini&egrave;re</i> of ferns ornamented the centre, and at
the four corners stood tall silver candlesticks of massive
design. No one would ever have dreamed that the family who were
to gather about this table had not all the money they needed.</p>
<p>The eldest sister leaned back in her chair and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly dreadful,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about cooking!
What am I to do? I went into the kitchen determined that that
odious B. Lafferty should never suspect that I hadn&rsquo;t made
biscuits every day of my life, but I couldn&rsquo;t have
impressed her that way, for she stood looking at me with the most
supercilious expression. She insisted upon taking the dough and
the roller right out of my hands. She declared that she knew
better than I did about making them, and the worst of it was, I
didn&rsquo;t know whether she did or not, and these are the
result. Hear them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor lifted one of the biscuits and let it drop upon the
table. It sounded like the fall of a little stone.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;You will have to take cooking lessons,&rdquo;
said Katherine. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t really cost much, and it
would pay in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not cost much, but when we have scarcely a
cent in our pockets and <i>owe bills</i>, we can&rsquo;t afford
lessons in anything. No, I shall have to keep a sharp lookout on
the bread-box, and trust to luck about other things. I am afraid
she only knows how to make two puddings, for when I speak about
the dessert, there is always some reason why it must be either
cornstarch or tapioca. I am perfectly certain they are the only
kinds she can make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not give up having dessert?&rdquo; suggested
Victoria, as she adjusted the cover of the basket. &ldquo;It
would save a little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victoria!&rdquo; exclaimed her sisters together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming down pretty low, if we can&rsquo;t have
dessert,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;What are you thinking
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only of saving money; and a lamp on the supper table
would be cheaper than candles,&rdquo; said Vic, as she took up
the basket and left the room. &ldquo;Come, Sophy. You carry the
pitcher of milk. Don&rsquo;t spill it, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where Vic gets those scrimpy
ideas,&rdquo; said Katherine, when they had gone. &ldquo;She
actually said again to-day that she thought we could do without
salad, that the sweet oil for the dressing was so expensive; and
when we went to Boston together the other day, she insisted upon
walking all the way from the station to Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s, just
to save five cents! She was perfectly horrified at my getting
those embroidered handkerchiefs, and yet they were so cheap. It
is a perfect bore to have her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor said nothing. She thought that Victoria went to an
extreme, perhaps; but it was better for the family purse than
Katherine&rsquo;s course, and the suggestion about the candles
contained a good deal of common sense. A lamp would do just as
well, and candles were expensive; but then they made the table
look so much prettier. How provoking it was, thought Honor, to be
obliged to do without so small and simple a luxury as candles on
the supper-table!</p>
<p>With an air of resignation, she rose and lighted a lamp, which
she placed upon the table. Then she blew out the candles, and
removed them to the mantelpiece.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;Oh, Honor!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Why do
you do that? You are getting to be as bad as Vic herself. You
might at least leave them on the table unlighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the mere show of them?&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;Never! and Vic is right. Candles are expensive. I wonder
if there is anything else we can give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she looked about with a gesture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sugar in our tea, I suppose,&rdquo; said Katherine,
with what she considered fine sarcasm, &ldquo;or even tea itself.
Perhaps you would like to do without forks. We can sell the
silver, for instance. For my part, I shall never give in to this
stingy spirit that is taking possession of the rest of you. I am
sure we are not as poor as all that, and we are certainly making
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor made no reply. When Katherine talked in this strain, it
was useless to argue with her, and presently Victoria and Sophy
returned, and they took their places at the table.</p>
<p>Dave Carney spent some time with Peter in the barn, and when
he left, he promised to return the next day, and see how the dog
was progressing. When Peter asked him where he lived, he returned
an evasive answer. The two boys, so differently <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>placed in
the world, found that they had much in common. Dave knew almost
as much as Peter did about the ways of animals and birds, and was
deeply interested in all that his new friend had to say upon the
subject, besides recounting many of his own experiences in the
woods.</p>
<p>When he came the next day, he offered to help Peter with his
mushrooms, and in return for this Peter, at Victoria&rsquo;s
suggestion, presented him with a full suit of outgrown clothes
which fitted him exactly; for although he was older than Peter,
he was of slighter build and was shorter. Peter superintended his
toilet when he tried on the garments at the barn, fastening his
collar for him, and even tying a blue cravat about his neck.
Finally he placed a brown cap upon his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you look like a regular
dude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave surveyed himself in the little mirror and then glanced at
his nice trousers and whole shoes. A pleased smile stole over his
face, and then he looked at Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgit it,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>It was finally arranged that Carney should come to Glen Arden
every day to do whatever came to hand, in return for his three
meals and a small <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>sum weekly. He was to take part in the mushroom culture
and to assist Victoria with her violets, and also to carry coal
for B. Lafferty. Even Honor, who had at first disapproved of this
arrangement, found him useful in many different ways. He was
always ready to go to the village upon an errand, or to make
himself useful about the house. In fact, Dave Carney soon came to
be regarded as an important and indispensable member of the
family, and as he ate with Blanch in the kitchen, that difficulty
no longer existed.</p>
<p>Peter told no one, not even Victoria, of the incident which
led to his acquaintance with Carney, and the boy knew this, and
his gratitude increased tenfold.</p>
<p>Peter made two warm friends that day. The dog soon recovered,
and his devotion to the boy who had saved his life was touching
in the extreme. When Peter was at home he never left him, and
when he was at school he wandered disconsolately about the house
or place, taking up his position at the head of the avenue when
the time approached for his master to return, and rushing to meet
him when he appeared in the distance.</p>
<p>Since his recovery and owing to the numerous <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>baths which
Peter and Carney gave him he had so far improved in appearance
that the sisters consented to his presence in the house; and they
soon became greatly attached to him, although he paid but little
attention to any one but his master. He was not a handsome dog,
being tall and ungainly, with a coat of yellowish bristly hair.
He was unmistakably a mongrel, and perhaps for that very reason
was unusually intelligent. He knew each one of the family by name
almost immediately, and seemed to understand everything that was
said to him. Victoria declared that he was the brightest of the
Starrs, and hence came his name.</p>
<p>There was great discussion upon this point, and for days the
newcomer went unchristened. Apparently he had never had a name
before, for although they tried every title by which a dog could
possibly be known, he failed to respond, and only smiled
roguishly at their efforts, for he was a happy-hearted dog with a
most cheerful smile. Nothing that was suggested satisfied the
critical Peter. Finally Honor said, &ldquo;He will just have to
go without a name. He will have to be known as the Starr
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the dog Starr,&rdquo; said Victoria, quickly.
&ldquo;Do <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>you see? The dog-star! By the way, what is the name of
the dog-star. Let us look it up in the
Encyclop&aelig;dia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did so, and found that it was &ldquo;Sirius,&rdquo; and
also that Sirius was the brightest of the fixed stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the brightest of these Starrs,&rdquo; cried
Victoria, as she hugged the long-suffering but none the less
fortunate animal. &ldquo;Do, Peter, name him Sirius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for a wonder Peter consented; and although
&ldquo;Sirius&rdquo; was a difficult name to call when one was in
a hurry, for instance, it was such an appropriate title that no
one objected.</p>
<p>In the meantime the month of November drew to a close, and on
the first day of December the amount of mail for the family at
Glen Arden was unusually large. There was the grocer&rsquo;s
bill, and the butcher&rsquo;s bill, and there were other
household accounts; but in addition to these there was the one
from the school-furniture store in Boston. It was addressed to
Honor, and with an exclamation of dismay she glanced at the
amount. Fifty-five dollars and eighty cents!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katherine!&rdquo; she said, looking at her sister,
and letting the bill fall into her lap.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Katherine.
&ldquo;You look as if you had seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Honor, solemnly. &ldquo;This is the
bill for the schoolroom furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you expected it, didn&rsquo;t you? How much is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-five dollars and eighty cents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that isn&rsquo;t very much,&rdquo; returned
Katherine, easily. &ldquo;Scarcely more than fifty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t got it. How are we going to pay
for it, and why did you get all these things?&rdquo; groaned
Honor, as she looked at the items. &ldquo;Five dollars for the
globe, and we could easily have done without it, or used a little
cheap one. Five dollars for the blackboard! And all this for
copy-books and blank-books! You ought never to have bought them,
and if you did, you oughtn&rsquo;t to have had them charged. And
have you begun to make any money with your typewriter
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you even learned to use it yet? Have you done
<i>anything</i> with it? The money you spent on that typewriter
might just as well have been thrown into the river. Katherine,
Katherine, <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>how could you do it! I verily believe we shall have to
apply to Aunt Sophia for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine sprang from her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Honor, you are too
absurd. I tell you, we are making money with the school and the
music scholars. As for the typewriter, you are too disagreeable!
Of course it will pay in time. I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t had time
to learn to use it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dared not add that her ardor had been somewhat lessened by
a small paragraph which she had chanced to see in the newspaper.
It was to the effect that the use of the typewriter unfitted the
fingers for the piano, that they were apt to become stiff and to
lose their accustomed skill. It was only a newspaper paragraph,
to be sure, but it had frightened Katherine. She even
acknowledged to herself that she regretted her purchase, but she
had no intention of making this known to her sisters.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, how should the bills be paid?</p>
<h2><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VICTORIA GOES IN SEARCH OF
FUNDS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Honor</span> thought over the subject
during the day and decided that they must hold a council of war.
Some means must be decided upon for paying the bills. It was
precisely one month since they had undertaken to support
themselves, and already they were in difficulty. It would be
humiliating to be forced to appeal so soon to Mr. Abbott for
help, and yet they would far rather ask him than their Aunt
Sophia. But perhaps there was some other way.</p>
<p>The school bills had been sent out,&mdash;they were issued in
advance,&mdash;but as yet there had been no response, and even
when there was, the amount would help very little. Six children
at twenty dollars each for the term, one hundred and twenty
dollars. The household bills for the month of November amounted
to what seemed a large sum in these straitened times,&mdash;and
they did not <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>include the one for the school furniture,&mdash;and the
money which they should receive from the pupils would be for the
next four months.</p>
<p>There were the music scholars, to be sure, but they were but
five, and Katherine received only fifty cents an hour. Mushrooms
and violets, though a paying industry in theory, had not yet
begun to show practical results. Six hundred dollars a year came
to them, as they supposed, from their father&rsquo;s estate, and
there were five persons to be clothed and fed. Had they been
foolish, after all, not to accept their aunt&rsquo;s offer?
Honor, sitting in the western window of the parlor that afternoon
in December, while she waited for her sisters to join her there,
wondered if they had made a mistake.</p>
<p>There had been a light fall of snow that day, just enough to
whiten the ground and to rest lightly upon the branches of the
cedar trees. The sun was shining now, shortly before setting, and
the world looked very beautiful. But Honor was in no mood to
enjoy the prospect. She felt an overburdening sense of
responsibility. She was the eldest, the family were practically
left in her care, and she missed her father more than words <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>could
express. Was she doing right to refuse the help which her
father&rsquo;s sister had offered?</p>
<p>Presently the front door opened, and Victoria walked in. She
was singing, to a tune of her own invention, her favorite
quotation from Shakespeare:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath way,<br />
And merrily hent the stile&mdash;a.<br />
A merry heart goes all the way,<br />
Your sad tires in a mile&mdash;a.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was about to begin it for the second time, when she saw
Honor sitting on the sofa in the bay-window. Her very attitude
appeared depressed, for she was leaning her head on her hand, as
her elbow rested on the back of the sofa, and she idly swung one
foot to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just perfect out,&rdquo; said Victoria, coming
into the room. A bright color glowed in her cheeks, and her voice
was gay and exhilarated from her walk in the fresh air. &ldquo;It
is growing colder, and there is a snap about everything. Have you
been out, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all day? Oh, put on your things and come out for a
walk! It is just the afternoon for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Honor, &ldquo;I am waiting for
you and Katherine. I don&rsquo;t know where she can
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want us for?&rdquo; asked Victoria, feeling
a pang of something like depression, her sister&rsquo;s tone was
so dreary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk things over, and here comes Katherine at
last. I thought you were never coming. Where have you been,
Katherine? Indeed, somebody must suggest some way of getting
money at once. Those bills are weighing upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a way,&rdquo; said Victoria, taking the other
corner of the sofa, while Katherine threw herself into an
arm-chair. &ldquo;There is a way, but I suppose you will both be
perfectly horrified if I even suggest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked her sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise not to exclaim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly surprise us after your other
suggestions,&rdquo; remarked Katherine, gloomily. &ldquo;I shall
be quite resigned, even if you tell us we are to live on bread
and water and wear ready-made clothes at five dollars a
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might do worse,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;but
this is quite different. We have so many things&rdquo; (she <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>looked
about the room as she spoke), &ldquo;why&mdash;indeed, girls, I
scarcely dare say it&mdash;why can&rsquo;t we sell
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. Honor was the first to find her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell something!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Sell
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a picture or two, or some books, or a piece of
silver. Or isn&rsquo;t there any jewelry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Victoria, you can&rsquo;t really mean it?&rdquo;
cried Katherine, in an incredulous voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
think that you really mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell our family heirlooms?&rdquo; exclaimed Honor,
starting to her feet and gazing at her younger sister with the
air of a tragedy queen. &ldquo;Sell the books and the pictures
that father collected with so much pride? Sell the silver which
belonged to our great-great-grandmother? Victoria, are you
perfectly crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Victoria, stoutly, &ldquo;not at all
so, but I knew you would take it in that way. Of course, I
don&rsquo;t mean the family things, but I mean some of the books,
or those etchings that are in the portfolio. I know well enough
how dearly father loved them, but he certainly loved us more, and
if he were here now and knew how <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>poor we are, he would be the first
to say that we must do something to get money, and that we had
better sell such useless things as those etchings are. They
don&rsquo;t do us any good, for we never look at them, and he
would far rather have us sell them than owe money. You know
father had a perfect horror of unpaid bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria spoke rapidly, for she had become excited. The
opposition manifested by her sisters only served to strengthen
her belief in the common sense of her suggestion, and she felt
confident that her plan was a good one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if Aunt Sophia wouldn&rsquo;t buy
something of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victoria!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be so shocked. Aunt Sophia with
all her aggravatingness is very kind-hearted, and she is fond of
us in a way. She might buy something of us, and when we grow rich
we could buy it back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we do!&rdquo; said Katherine, with fine sarcasm.
&ldquo;All I can say is that if Aunt Sophia is to be applied to,
I shall have nothing to do with it. Victoria can run the affair
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Victoria, &ldquo;if Honor is
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>willing,
I will. I will go to town to-morrow, and see Aunt Sophia. I only
wish Mr. Abbott were at home, but he said his business would keep
him away two weeks. Shall I go, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Honor, drearily. &ldquo;I
have nothing more to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night we can talk over what we had better offer for
sale,&rdquo; continued Victoria. &ldquo;I think it will be quite
good fun, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my idea of fun,&rdquo; said Honor, &ldquo;but
I am willing to do almost anything for a little money. How little
we supposed this time last year that we should ever be in such
need! It just shows that we can&rsquo;t be sure of
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Victoria, abruptly changing the
subject, &ldquo;did you know that the house on the hill has been
taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my scholars said something about it
to-day,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;She said their name was
Madison, and there are a girl and a boy, I believe. I wonder if
they are nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, as they are to be such near
neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; remarked
Honor, &ldquo;for we shall see nothing of them. We <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>have no
time to make new acquaintances and we are too poor. If they have
taken the house on the hill, they must be very well off, and that
is all the more reason for us to avoid them. We are nothing but
paupers, working for our living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor, how morbid you are getting on that
subject!&rdquo; cried Victoria, while Katherine laughed somewhat
bitterly. &ldquo;If they are nice, I shall be glad to know them,
and so will you. Do cheer up a bit,&rdquo; she added, rising as
she spoke. &ldquo;I am going to find Peter now and see how they
are progressing with the mushroom bed. Don&rsquo;t worry, Honor.
It will all come right some day.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath way,<br />
And merrily hent the stile&mdash;a.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sisters heard the fresh young voice as Victoria, having
put on her jacket again, departed in search of Peter. Katherine
seated herself at the piano, as she was apt to do when under any
stress of emotion, and Honor went to her own room. She was
determined that no one should see her cry if she could help it,
but life was at present very disheartening, let Victoria suggest
and sing as she would.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Vic
on her way to the barn met Sophy, and together they sought their
brother. They found him sitting with Dave Carney in the
harness-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come along in,&rdquo; said he with unexpected
cordiality, while Carney rose from the box upon which he was
seated, and Sirius rapped a welcome on the floor with his long
tail. The oddest part of Sirius&rsquo;s somewhat grotesque
appearance was the great length of his tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just talking about the mushroom bed, and we
can&rsquo;t decide whether to have it in the cellar, or in the
shed, or in the barn, or out of doors. Of course you don&rsquo;t
really know any more about it, Vic, than I do, but what do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you send for the books?&rdquo; asked his sister, as
she seated herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they came by the noon mail. A lot about edible
mushrooms, and here it tells how to raise them,&rdquo; said
Peter, giving her two or three pamphlets which he had been
studying.</p>
<p>He had, upon the suggestion of the florist at Fordham, sent to
Washington for these pamphlets, which were printed and published
by the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe it is going to be a good thing, <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Vic. They
seem easy to raise, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if there was
money in them. We might live on them ourselves, and save
butcher&rsquo;s bills. You know the Chinese eat them a
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; responded Victoria, although
somewhat doubtfully; &ldquo;but then it always seems as if the
Chinese ate such queer things&mdash;mice, for instance. I
don&rsquo;t think I should like to copy the Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! You don&rsquo;t really believe that they eat
mice, do you?&rdquo; said Peter, with lofty scorn. &ldquo;A lot
is made up about the Chinese, because we don&rsquo;t really know
much about them. But they do a large business in mushrooms, or
&lsquo;edible fungi,&rsquo; as they are called. They import them
from Japan and Tahiti, and even from Australia and New Zealand.
They make soup out of fungus in China; and do you know in New
Zealand they eat a fungus that grows out of the body of a big
caterpillar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, horrible!&rdquo; cried Victoria.
&ldquo;Sophy&rsquo;s eyes look as big as saucers. Don&rsquo;t
tell any more such dreadful tales, Peter. We won&rsquo;t raise
that kind, at any rate. Have you decided where to have the
beds?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we were talking about
before you came out. I was thinking of the shed at the back of
the barn, and Carney thinks that would be a good place. I
don&rsquo;t believe out of doors will do in our climate; and
Smith, the man at Fordham, said the shed was the best. I wish we
could make a regular mushroom house, like the ones they show
pictures of in these pamphlets, but I suppose it would cost a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better wait until next year for that,&rdquo;
said the practical Victoria. &ldquo;Then we can tell whether they
are going to pay or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They discussed the matter for some time, until the gathering
darkness warned Victoria that it was time for her and Sophy to go
back to the house; and they left the boys still absorbed in the
subject.</p>
<p>The next day was Saturday, and it was decided to make use of
the holiday by arranging the mushroom bed. The boys followed
closely the directions for doing this, which were given in their
pamphlets; but after making the bed, they were forced to wait for
a few days before introducing the seed, or spawn, until the
temperature of the bed should have reached the proper degree.
This <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>they were to discover by means of the ground
thermometer which Peter had purchased.</p>
<p>The day being Saturday, Victoria was free to go to Boston to
call upon her aunt. The girls had further discussed the matter
the evening before, and had decided that Victoria&rsquo;s plan
must be followed, if they wished to avert the ruin which seemed
to be staring them in the face. If Aunt Sophia declined to buy
the pictures which they had determined to sell, they must be
disposed of in some other way. Victoria had a private plan of her
own for raising some ready money, but of this she had said
nothing to her sisters.</p>
<p>She went to Boston in one of the early trains with a large
flat package under her arm, and a small but heavy one in her
pocket. The day was a fine one, and the streets were filled with
Christmas shoppers, the stores being already crowded, early in
the morning though it was.</p>
<p>Victoria walked quickly from the station to her aunt&rsquo;s
house. The world seemed very bright this morning, even though
bills were unpaid and prospects dreary. As the young girl hurried
along, one might easily have imagined from her happy face and her
well-dressed figure that she was in <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the most comfortable circumstances
possible, and that her package was a Christmas present which she
had purchased, instead of being four of her father&rsquo;s
precious etchings with which the sisters, after much hesitation
and disinclination, had decided to part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what kind of a person I am,&rdquo; thought
Victoria as she walked. &ldquo;I wonder what sort of a character
I really have. I don&rsquo;t seem to get as gloomy as Honor or as
furious as Katherine over being poor. Does it mean that I
don&rsquo;t realize as they do how very bad things are? It always
seems as if there must be some way out, no matter how gloomy and
awful things may look. Perhaps I&rsquo;m rather shallow and
can&rsquo;t grasp the situation. Some day when I have time I am
going to sit down and study my own nature, but there are ever so
many things that must be done first. And after all, it
doesn&rsquo;t seem worth while to waste time over that. I might
find out that I was absolutely worthless, and that would be so
discouraging. I suppose a great many people would say that I
ought to examine myself more, and correct my faults, and all
that, and I suppose I ought; but if I did I know I should get <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>depressed,
and it really seems as if one of us should try to keep bright and
cheerful, and I seem to be the one that it comes easiest to. I
wish I had some one to ask about such things&mdash;a mother, for
instance. Holloa, here I am at Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s already. I
hope she is at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But inquiry proved that already Mrs. Wentworth Ward had gone
out. She would not return until five o&rsquo;clock that
afternoon, the maid said. She had gone to Providence to attend a
meeting. Would not Miss Victoria come in and rest a bit?</p>
<p>But Victoria declined the invitation. She had quickly
determined to put her other plans into action, and no time should
be lost.</p>
<p>It did not take long to reach a certain silversmith&rsquo;s of
whom she had heard, and whom she knew to be honest, although his
shop was neither large nor fashionable. Fortunately no customers
were in the store, and the proprietor could attend to her
himself. She produced the small heavy package from her pocket,
and proceeded to untie it. In it were a pair of old-fashioned
gold earrings, a watch and chain, and one or two chased rings.
These articles had been left to Victoria <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>by the will
of her grandmother. The watch, which was very old, and had long
since ceased to go, was of no great value as a timepiece, she
supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to sell these things,&rdquo; said she, bravely.
&ldquo;Will you buy them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, who had kind eyes, Victoria thought, looked at
them critically. Then he glanced benignly at the owner of the
trinkets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to sell them?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I really do,&rdquo; returned Victoria. &ldquo;I
need the money. How much will you give me for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell that until I&rsquo;ve taken them
apart and weighed the gold. Come back next week, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week!&rdquo; cried Victoria. &ldquo;Oh,
can&rsquo;t you do it now? I do want to take the money home
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t you going to buy Christmas presents
with it?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed, I&rsquo;m not. We really need the money.
Couldn&rsquo;t you tell me if I were to come back this afternoon?
At three o&rsquo;clock, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Very well. Come in at three, and I&rsquo;ll try
to have them weighed before that. These earrings are hollow, I
guess, and there ain&rsquo;t so very much gold in this open-faced
watch. Here&rsquo;s a receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scrawled something on a bit of paper which he gave to
Victoria, and she thanked him and left the shop. She then took
her way to a picture store. It was a large one that was much
frequented, and it required some determination on her part to go
in and display her wares. The clerks were such fashionably
dressed young men that she felt somewhat in awe of them, and they
all appeared to be so busy that it was long before she was
noticed at all.</p>
<p>At last, however, one of them stepped up to her and asked her
what she wished. For a moment Victoria could not find her voice,
and when she finally spoke it was so low and trembling that the
clerk could not understand her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to look at etchings?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Right over here, please. Summers, show this young lady
some etchings. I have another customer.&rdquo; And he turned to a
gentleman who was looking at some pictures with the air of
intending to buy one if not more.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;You have
made a mistake. I don&rsquo;t want to look at etchings. I want to
sell those I have here. I thought that&mdash;that
perhaps&mdash;you would buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was now perfectly audible. In her effort to make
herself understood it reached farther than she intended. The two
clerks and the gentleman who stood there all turned and looked at
Victoria, and she with her package under her arm felt as though
she should like to sink through the floor and disappear forever
from their sight.</p>
<h2><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UNEXPECTED GENEROSITY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this was no time in which to
give way to embarrassment. Having undertaken the expedition in
search of funds, Victoria felt that she must carry it bravely
through, come what would. With fingers that trembled
conspicuously she untied the cord and removed the wrappings, and
presently disclosed to the view of the three men four etchings of
such rare merit that they exclaimed with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, artist&rsquo;s proofs!&rdquo; said the gentleman
who had been looking at pictures. &ldquo;And a signature worth
having,&rdquo; he added, as he glanced at the name written
beneath the etching he held in his hand. &ldquo;May I ask what
the price of this one is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; faltered
Victoria. &ldquo;I thought they could tell me here what they are
worth. You see my father bought them and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly. She did not wish to take these strangers
into her confidence, but the three <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>men saw her black dress and imagined
the rest. And yet she did not look as if she were in need of
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they were worth twenty-five dollars
apiece, should not you?&rdquo; said the gentleman, turning to the
clerks.</p>
<p>They were unwilling to mention any price, and one of them went
in search of the owner of the store. Victoria could scarcely
repress a little gasp of surprise. She had no idea that the
pictures were worth so much, for they were small ones. If she
succeeded in selling all of them in addition to the gold which
she had left with the jeweller, she would go home with a large
fortune in her pocket, and the unpaid bills could be settled at
once.</p>
<p>She glanced at the young man, who appeared to be absorbed in
examination of the etchings while he waited to hear their value.
He was very tall and slight, with straight features, and neither
beard nor moustache, which made him look younger than perhaps he
really was. Victoria decided that he was nice looking, and was
probably about twenty-five. He seemed to be well known at the
shop, for the clerks treated him with marked attention and <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>called him
by name, but Victoria could not hear it distinctly enough to know
what it was.</p>
<p>Again she told herself that he was very nice looking, and that
he had the most charming manners she had ever seen, though
perhaps she was influenced by his interest in her pictures and
his evident desire to buy one. Presently the picture-dealer
himself came forward and examined critically the four
etchings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are genuine artist&rsquo;s proofs,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I shall try to sell them myself at twenty dollars
each. Probably they cost more than that, but in the present state
of business they will not bring as much as they did. I will give
you fifteen apiece for them and take the four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will give you twenty-five for this one,&rdquo;
said the young man, holding up the one that he had first looked
at. &ldquo;It is a gem, and I will get you to frame it for
me,&rdquo; he added, turning to the dealer. &ldquo;Do it for me
as soon as you can, for I want to give it away for a Christmas
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out a roll of bills from his pocket, and counting out
twenty-five dollars he handed the money to Victoria, taking off
his hat as he did so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;Thank you very much for giving me the
opportunity of securing such a prize,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Victoria hesitated and blushed scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly like to take it,&rdquo; she said
simply, as she looked up at him. &ldquo;You are giving me too
much. You could buy it of the shop for twenty dollars. Please
don&rsquo;t give me more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to pay five dollars more for the privilege
of&mdash;of having first choice,&rdquo; he said, abruptly
changing the termination of his sentence.</p>
<p>Victoria said no more, but took the money, and at the same
time one of the clerks brought her forty-five dollars for the
remaining three. She thanked them all and hurried from the
shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather an odd case,&rdquo; said the picture-dealer to
the young man. &ldquo;The man who bought those etchings in the
first place knew what he was about. I daresay I shan&rsquo;t sell
them, but I didn&rsquo;t want to let such good things go; and
besides, she seemed like a nice little girl. I have a daughter
just about her age and&mdash;well, no matter. Now, sir, what kind
of a frame do you wish, and how about those other pictures you
were looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man turned to look at samples of <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>frames, but
his mind was more occupied with the incident which had just taken
place than with his purchases. He, too, felt sorry for the girl.
She was unmistakably a lady, and it must have been a trying
position for her. He would not care to have his sister in such a
predicament, he said to himself.</p>
<p>He was a man of somewhat old-fashioned notions, one who
believed that the men of the family should take care of the
women. He wondered if there was no one to look out for this young
girl, who seemed to be not more than fifteen,&mdash;no older
person who could have come with her. Then dismissing the subject
from his thoughts for the time being, he devoted his whole
attention to the choice of a frame.</p>
<p>Victoria, when she left the shop, felt that all their
difficulties were at an end. She had a roll of bills in her
pocket,&mdash;she put her hand in more than once as she walked,
to make sure that the money was safe,&mdash;and if all went as
smoothly as she hoped, she would have more before the day was
over. She had left home that morning with her railroad ticket and
twenty-five cents for emergencies; she expected to return in
affluence, <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>and it had all been done without the intervention of
Aunt Sophia. How fortunate it was that Aunt Sophia had elected to
go to Providence on this day of all others! What would she say to
such a proceeding if she ever happened to hear of it?</p>
<p>Victoria smiled to herself at the idea. Very probably Aunt
Sophia dealt at that picture store herself. How little the dealer
suspected that she was the niece of Mrs. Wentworth Ward of Beacon
Street,&mdash;or the young man who had given her twenty-five
dollars. Then in a flash the other side of the occurrence
presented itself. Should she have taken so much from him? Was the
etching worth that much? Why should she have calmly allowed
herself to accept twenty-five dollars from him and only fifteen
from the dealer? Had she made herself an object of charity?</p>
<p>She had walked across the Common, and was about to cross
Tremont Street when she reached this point in her reflections,
and so absorbed was she in the subject that she barely escaped
being run over by one of the innumerable electric cars which were
passing in long succession, interspersed with dashing herdics and
hurrying cabs. <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>All the world seemed to be in haste this sharp winter
morning, and a motorman shouted angrily to her as she attempted
to cross in front of his car.</p>
<p>She reached the other side of the street in safety, and then
she wondered what she should do next. She had no Christmas
shopping to consume her time, for their gifts to one another were
to be very simple this year and were to be made at home. The
stores on Temple Place were packed with people, and as she walked
she was jostled and almost bruised by the inevitable handbags,
without which Boston shoppers are rarely seen. It was now only
half-past ten, and she must stay in town until after three, the
hour of her appointment with the jeweller. She determined to go
back to her aunt&rsquo;s, and remain there until the afternoon,
and there she could think quietly of the events of the
morning.</p>
<p>She did this, and was shown by the maid into the library and
told to make herself at home. Although Mrs. Wentworth Ward was
their own aunt, the Starrs had never felt for her the affection
which is so common in that relationship. It had always been more
or less of an effort for them to <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>go to her house, and their calls
there were unmistakably &ldquo;duty visits.&rdquo; Mrs. Ward was
without doubt very trying at times, and the girls were in her
opinion absurdly independent.</p>
<p>There were faults on both sides, perhaps, as there usually are
in such cases. Victoria, sitting in the luxurious library,
thought it all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Aunt Sophia were only like some aunts,&rdquo; she
said to herself, &ldquo;how nice it would have been to come and
live with her! Think of this big house and no one in it but
herself; but oh, I hope we shall never have to do it! I do wonder
what the girls will say about my sales this morning. I felt
exactly like a book agent or a pedler. Dear me, I only hope I
shall never see that young man again! He was just as nice as he
could be, but I don&rsquo;t want ever to meet him! He really made
me a present of ten dollars, you might say. What will Honor think
of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock came at last, and as the hands of the
clock on the steeple of the Old South Church pointed to the hour,
Victoria entered the shop where she had left her gold that
morning. She knew little of the value of watches, but she fancied
that when new they cost not less than <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>one hundred dollars, and often very
much more; therefore she hoped for at least fifty for hers. Her
disappointment was consequently very great when she learned that
it was worth exactly thirteen dollars and seventy-five cents,
while the other trinkets would bring but seven and a half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chain and the earrings are hollow,&rdquo; said the
man, &ldquo;and the works of the watch are good for nothing. You
may be glad to get this much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thanked him and left the store feeling somewhat
crestfallen, although twenty-one dollars and a quarter made a sum
not to be despised.</p>
<p>The girls were eagerly awaiting her return, and when she
displayed her roll of bills and informed them that she had
brought them ninety-one dollars and twenty-five cents, they could
scarcely believe her. Honor looked grave over the account of the
young man&rsquo;s generosity, as Victoria had supposed that she
would, and she also expressed the hope that they might never see
him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be simply unendurable to feel that we were
under obligations to him,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but it
isn&rsquo;t at all likely that we shall ever meet him. We
don&rsquo;t see many people but those who live in Fordham, and if
he lived anywhere in this <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>neighborhood, you would have known
him by sight. You are sure you never saw him before,
Vic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure. He was probably some Boston swell, but
he was an awfully nice one, and if it were not for that ten
dollars, I should really like to know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well say if it were not for that whole
ninety-one dollars and twenty-five cents,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;I am glad enough to get the money, but I can&rsquo;t bear
to think of your having to go to those shops by yourself and sell
things. I ought to have gone with you, Vic. Indeed, I ought! It
was very cowardly and selfish for me to let you go alone&mdash;a
young thing like you. Some one might have been impertinent to
you, and then I should never have forgiven myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Honor!&rdquo; laughed her young sister.
&ldquo;You are not so very much older yourself, and I went to
such respectable places that of course no one would be
impertinent. And, besides, I wanted to surprise you about the
gold. I wanted to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Honor shook her head. She knew that she had been remiss,
and that her father would not have approved of Victoria&rsquo;s
solitary expedition. <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>If the young man whom she had met
was truly a gentleman, as Vic declared that he was, what could he
have thought of such a proceeding? He certainly must suppose that
her relatives were very careless and very peculiar people, to say
the least, and Honor hoped with all her heart that he would never
cross her path again.</p>
<p>But it was a great source of comfort to feel that their bills
could now be paid; and the girls went to bed that night feeling
comparatively happy, for the consciousness of their debts had
weighed upon them all. Katherine&mdash;though she would not
acknowledge it&mdash;had felt particularly uncomfortable, for the
unused typewriter continued to stare her in the face. Now she
felt quite relieved about it, and she had serious thoughts of
running into Boston Monday afternoon to buy Christmas presents
for the family. It would be such a surprise to them, and she
should of course use her own money.</p>
<p>Within half an hour she had fully made up her mind to do this,
and was already planning what she should bestow upon each one,
when a remark of Honor&rsquo;s warned her that it would be wiser
not to carry out her intentions.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said the eldest sister,
&ldquo;that we shall not lose our heads over our unexpected good
fortune. We mustn&rsquo;t spend a bit more than we can possibly
help. Remember, we don&rsquo;t want any more bills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winter days passed quickly, filled as they were with
things of importance to do. The first planting of mushrooms was
successful; and Peter, upon his return from the Boston market, to
which he took them, proudly added his earnings to the family
purse. He pretended that he felt it but a small thing to do, and
that the future would prove that he was considering deeds of far
greater moment than the cultivation of mushrooms; but in reality
he was becoming immensely interested in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s violets bloomed in February, and they also
were taken to Boston, and disposed of to a florist. Dave Carney
attended to this part of the business for her, and was indeed
most useful in every way. The Starrs had never been able to
discover anything about the antecedents of this member of the
household, and in fact they had not made any great effort to do
so. They liked the boy, and they found him both obliging and
dependable. Peter knew that he had a brother, <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>for he saw
one day in Fordham a young man who so closely resembled Dave that
he was on the point of speaking to him; and when he questioned
Dave upon the subject, the boy told him briefly that it was his
brother, and that he was a few years older than himself. He said
nothing more, and Peter did not ask for further information, as
was characteristic of him.</p>
<p>It was a mild winter, and although there were frequent falls
of snow, they were always succeeded by days of such springlike
warmth that there was neither sleighing nor coasting, and
scarcely any skating.</p>
<p>His sisters suspected that Peter was not particularly happy in
his school life, but he did not tell them so. He was a boy who
did not make friends easily, and the mere knowledge that he was
looked upon as an interloper by the boys at the school which he
attended, drove him still farther into his shell, as it were. He
had little to do with them, and usually came home as soon as the
day&rsquo;s session was over.</p>
<p>Sophy and Sirius together always watched eagerly for his
return, both consumed with the same hope and desire that Peter
would invite <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>them to join him in whatever he intended to do&mdash;a
hope which was more apt to be fulfilled in the case of Sirius
than of Sophy. An eight-year-old sister is by no means so
interesting a companion, Peter thought, as an active and
particularly intelligent dog.</p>
<p>There were occasions, however, when Sophy was bidden to bear
him company; and, on a certain afternoon, the little girl was
made happy by the announcement that Peter was going for a walk,
and if she wanted to go, and would promise not to get tired, and
not to make a fuss if they came across any muskrats or field
mice, and, in fact, to show no signs of fear about anything which
they might meet, she should be allowed to accompany her brother
and his dog.</p>
<p>Sophy, transported with delight, and ready to promise anything
in the way of courage, ran for her hat and jacket and quickly
followed Peter to the barn, whither he gone to inspect the
mushroom bed. It was a mild day in early spring. The young leaves
had just burst forth upon the trees, and the smell of earth, and
the gentle murmurings of the little brooks in pasture and woods,
and the soft freshness of the breeze, showed that <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>another
winter had passed. Many of the birds had returned to their summer
homes and were busily engaged in nest-building, and little
chipmunks darted about in a ceaseless game of tag, pausing for a
moment to peer inquisitively at Sophy with their bright eyes, and
then vanishing from sight. Peter, having attended to his affairs
at the barn, took his way across the pasture. Sirius scampered on
in advance, nosing here and there along the path, stopping to
investigate every hole and barking noisily at a gray squirrel,
which climbed the trunk of a tree at his approach, and then sat
on a branch in safety, but extreme indignation. &ldquo;Do
squirrels go to sleep in winter, Peter?&rdquo; asked Sophy, as
she trudged along close to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do usually, but it was so warm this winter I guess
they didn&rsquo;t get so sound asleep. I&rsquo;ll tell you
something, Soph. Carney and I both think the same thing. You know
people always say that when there are a lot of nuts, it means
that we are going to have a cold winter and the squirrels will
have plenty to eat. Well, you know there were plenty of nuts last
fall, and look at the <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>winter we&rsquo;ve had! As warm as
toast. I think, and Carney thinks so, too, that it means a warm
winter to have so many nuts. The squirrels are not going to sleep
so much, and so they will need more food. And look at last year;
scarcely any nuts in the fall and an awfully cold winter.
I&rsquo;m going to write to the <i>Transcript</i> about it
sometime, and see what people say. Other people will answer, and
it will be lots of fun. Sophy, I&rsquo;ll tell you something if
you&rsquo;ll promise never to tell. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean <i>never</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, never, until I&rsquo;ve done it. Then I&rsquo;ll
tell it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Peter, I&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; said the
little sister. The absence of the front teeth made her lisp
slightly, and Peter was alarmingly apt to make fun of this defect
when she used the letter &ldquo;s&rdquo;; but he was too much
engrossed with his subject at present to remark upon it, greatly
to Sophy&rsquo;s relief. A wave of gratification filled her
heart, both because of this and because her brother was
apparently about to make a confidante of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; she repeated solemnly.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;When I grow up,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;in a
very few years, I&rsquo;m going to write a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! A real printed book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, child. What other kind of a book could it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will it be about? A story like <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i> or <i>Little Women</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Little Women</i>! A girl&rsquo;s story! No indeed.
There won&rsquo;t be a girl in the book, that is one thing
certain. But it is to be about everything else. You know I really
know a lot about all sorts of things, and I intend to write about
everything that I know the least thing about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody me!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Sophy.
&ldquo;It will be an awful big book, Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will. It will probably be in a great many
volumes, all bound alike. It will be a regular Encyclopedia, and
people will probably look into it when they want to find out
about anything. I&rsquo;m going to tell about squirrels and birds
and mushrooms and muskrats and ants and bees and boys&rsquo;
games and schools&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to tell a lot about
schools, how to keep them, and all that&mdash;and travels&mdash;I
mean to travel as soon as I get enough money and have made <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>enough for
you girls to live on, and I shall write about every place I
visit, and oh, everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would have a little room in so many
volumes to say something about girls,&rdquo; murmured Sophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo; demanded Peter. &ldquo;Why should
I waste my time writing about them? You know very well, Sophy,
that girls aren&rsquo;t at all interesting, as ants or birds are,
for instance. You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sophy, humbly; &ldquo;I know that
because you have often told me so, but then, Peter, you can talk
to a girl, but you can&rsquo;t talk to an ant or a bird.
Doesn&rsquo;t that make some difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I would rather
watch a colony of ants any day than talk to a girl. Now mind,
Sophy, you don&rsquo;t tell any one about my book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t, Peter, and I think it&rsquo;s
going to be a splendid book, even if there are no girls in it. I
wish it was all made, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t take
long when I once get started on it. Hark! What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>A
strange wild cry rang through the woods. Sirius stopped short in
the path, with ears erect and motionless tail, while Sophy gave a
little shriek and clung to her brother&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<h2><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOPHY HAS AN ADVENTURE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What</span> is it?&rdquo; whispered
Sophy. &ldquo;Oh, Peter, is it a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost! Pooh, what nonsense! I&rsquo;ll never bring
you again, Sophy. You promised you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Peter, that was such a queer noise, and so
dreadful! If you could only tell me what it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An owl, very likely. Sometimes they make queer noises
like that. Let&rsquo;s try to find it. Sik &rsquo;em, Sirius, sik
&rsquo;em, sir!&rdquo; And disengaging himself from Sophy&rsquo;s
detaining hand he and the dog dashed into a by-path and
disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Sophy tried to follow, but there were many intersecting paths
or tracks in this part of the woods, and she was not in the least
sure which one her brother had taken. She ran along one, only to
find that it was rendered impassable by some brambles, so she
turned and went back to her <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>starting-point to try another. She
hoped that she should not again hear that terrible cry. It might
be an owl, as Peter had suggested, but then again it might not.
Peter did not really know for a certainty what it was. And then,
as suddenly as it had come before, rang out once more this
unearthly shriek. Sophy covered her face with her hands for an
instant. Then, indifferent as to what might become of her if only
she could get as far as possible from this terrible creature,
whatever it might be, she fled in the opposite direction to that
from which the sound appeared to come.</p>
<p>Peter and Sirius pursued their way with unerring instinct to a
large tree, upon the unleaved branch of which sat an immense owl.
What had at first disturbed it Peter could not guess, but at his
approach the owl gave another cry and then, spreading its wings,
flew aimlessly away into the deeper woods, flapping blindly among
the trees as it went.</p>
<p>It was unusual to see an owl so active in the daytime, and
Peter, his naturalist&rsquo;s nature all alive, followed closely,
anxious to see what would happen next. He stopped long enough,
however, to try to discover what had frightened the bird, but
could <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>find nothing. Then he concluded that the enemy,
whatever it was, must have disappeared.</p>
<p>It was a great horned owl, he was almost sure, and he knew
that one of that species was rarely seen so near civilization. He
followed it as closely as possible, but during his short stop to
look for the cause of its fright the owl had disappeared, and
Peter did not see it again. After spending some time in a
fruitless search for it, he returned to the edge of the wood,
supposing that he should find Sophy where he had left her; but
his thoughts were now distracted by something else.</p>
<p>The excited barking of Sirius proved that he had come upon
prey of some sort, and sure enough, when Peter reached the dog he
saw that he had discovered the entrance to a nest of field mice
beneath an old log, and already he had killed one of the parents.
Peter hoped to be in time to save the other, but he was not, and
scarcely liked to scold Sirius for the double murder, for he knew
the dog was only following the instincts of his kind. He
determined to secure the young ones, however, if young ones there
were.</p>
<p>He turned over the log, and there beneath it he found a neatly
made nest of long grasses, built <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>between the detached bark and the
log itself, and containing a number of tiny baby-mice. They were
orphans now, alas! the father and mother having both been killed
by Sirius, but Peter determined that the little ones should not
suffer for this misfortune. Carefully removing the nest from its
resting-place, he laid it in his cap and started for home. He
would have liked to examine the log further, for it seemed to be
an interesting place. A colony of large black ants, which had
fashioned for themselves a most elaborate dwelling, were running
about now in a distracted manner, owing to the sudden upheaval of
the log, which had probably been their undisturbed home for a
long time; and Peter would have been glad to watch them.</p>
<p>But from the way in which Sirius was barking and sniffing at a
hole in the log, Peter was led to suspect that another nest of
mice might be there, and rather than have that family also broken
up, and because he had no way of disposing of the little
creatures in his cap, he hurried away from the fascinating scene,
calling to the dog to follow.</p>
<p>He took a short cut across the woody pasture, which lay on the
outskirts of the thicker woods, <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>his mind so absorbed with the
adventure, that there was no room for thought of Sophy. He had
forgotten her as completely as though she did not exist.</p>
<p>Then, too, to his delight and surprise, he came across some
fungi. They were growing in a grassy place at the border of the
field, and just above the river. It seemed very early in the
season for mushrooms, but still these might be of an edible
variety, and if they were, would it not be an excellent plan to
take them home for supper? The family refrained always from
eating the cultivated mushrooms which Peter could sell, but if
they were beginning already to grow wild, they surely might be
indulged in.</p>
<p>Peter placed his cap on the top of a rock, which was too high
and too steep for Sirius to scale, and proceeded to test the
fungi. Were they edible or not? Unfortunately they were not, as
he soon discovered by bruising the gills. A white milk exuded,
and his reading had taught Peter that such were to be avoided.
Greatly disappointed, he picked up his capful of mice once more
and continued on his way.</p>
<p>Arrived at the barn, he made the little <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>orphans as
comfortable as possible in a place which was quite protected from
an attack by Sirius. He looked for Carney, but the boy was not to
be found. Victoria, however, was busy with her violets, and Peter
consulted with her as to the best method of disposing of his new
pets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria, when he showed them
to her. &ldquo;They are the cunningest things I ever saw, but you
are not going to keep them, are you, Peter? Why not set them
free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic, you must be perfectly crazy,&rdquo; said Peter.
&ldquo;Set them free, these poor little things without any father
or mother? They would be eaten right up by something. I had no
idea you were so cruel. I am going to keep them until
they&rsquo;re old enough to look out for themselves, and then
I&rsquo;ll take them out to the pasture and let them go, if they
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Katherine will say, she hates
mice so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine needn&rsquo;t know anything about them. She
never comes near the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Sophy is?&rdquo; Victoria called
after him as he walked off, but Peter did <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>not hear
her. He had placed his new pets as comfortably as possible, and
now he hastened back to the fascinating log, a good mile away
though it was.</p>
<p>Sirius accompanied him, but was ordered to remain at a safe
distance, lest the other families of mice should be disturbed,
and the dog was forced to content himself with digging a hole and
burrowing so deep after imaginary prey, that nothing could be
seen but a wagging tail above the ground.</p>
<p>Peter remained there until almost dark, watching the ants,
which had apparently recovered from the shock of the disturbance,
and were trying now to make themselves as comfortable as possible
after the fright. Some were carrying the eggs to a more retired
place than that in which they were, now that the log had been
turned upon another side, while others were engaged in repairing
the injured passage-ways of their dwelling.</p>
<p>At last the pangs of hunger warned Peter that it must be
nearly supper time, and he again went home, Sirius following,
covered with brown earth, but happy as a king, even though his
search <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>underground had failed to bring anything to light that
was desirable.</p>
<p>When Peter reached home, his three elder sisters came hurrying
to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Sophy?&rdquo; they cried with one voice.
&ldquo;What have you done with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stopped short in his walk across the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said he, a sudden dismay
striking him as he spoke. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she come
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! We haven&rsquo;t seen her since she went with you.
Oh, Peter, where is the child?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sophy in the meantime had wandered far into the woods. In her
desire to escape from the creature, whoever or whatever it might
be, that had so frightened her, she paid no heed to her
whereabouts. Blindly she ran on, stumbling, falling, and picking
herself up again only to run and fall once more. These woods were
not very extensive, but the paths in them were many and were
confusing, and Sophy without being in the least aware of it went
around and around in a complete circle more than once.</p>
<p>At one time she was very near the road, and had a carriage
chanced to pass at that moment she <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>would have heard it and would have
discovered where she was, and could then have easily made her way
home by the road; but there was no sound but the chirping and
twittering of the newly arrived birds among the branches of the
tall trees of this little forest.</p>
<p>When she paused from sheer exhaustion, she heard a stealthy
rustling among the dead leaves and the underbrush, and presently
a snake emerged, raising its head when it saw her, and darting
out its forked tongue in anger. It was a harmless little
creature, and no doubt was as anxious to escape from this
intruder as she could be to avoid the snake, but Sophy did not
stop to consider this. She forgot completely that Peter had often
told her that the snakes which frequented these woods and meadows
were not dangerous, and she fled precipitately from the spot.</p>
<p>At last her aimless wandering brought her to the extreme edge
of the wood at the point farthest away from home. To her joy she
saw an open space before her, and actually a piece of the sky was
visible. It was growing late apparently. The shadows of evening
had crept upon her in the woods without her being conscious of
them. Now <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>it seemed as if it must be twilight, although it was
yet far from being dark.</p>
<p>As she trudged along, too tired to run, she fancied that she
heard the voices of men. She paused for a moment, fearing new
dangers. Yes, some men were not far off, and as they were
speaking some strange jargon, Sophy suspected that they were
Italians. She was very much afraid of Italians, with their dark
skins and fiery black eyes. There were many at work upon the
railroad, and the child would go a long way around to avoid
meeting them even in broad daylight, and when she was with some
one else. Now when she was alone, and it was almost dark, she was
terrified indeed. The dangers of the forest were as nothing to
this. She was about to turn and run back when she heard their
voices growing fainter. Apparently they were leaving the spot for
the night. If she waited long enough, she could go home.</p>
<p>Sophy thought that she should feel safer if she were to say
her prayers, so she knelt down in the dead leaves and repeated
&ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; very softly, adding before she rose,
&ldquo;And please, God, take me safe home. I&rsquo;m so
frightened. For Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake, Amen.&rdquo; When she
had finished she <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>felt braver. It was all very quiet, and the men had
gone. She walked out of the wood and found in the dim light a
footpath, which she followed. It led past the base of the
embankment of the railroad, a sandy embankment which towered far
above her, and she soon reached the carriage road which passed
under the railroad at this point.</p>
<p>Sophy knew this road well, and she knew that by following it
towards the right she should eventually reach home, although it
was a long distance. She wondered where Peter was, if he had come
back to look for her, if he was in the forest now, searching for
her. And the girls, what were they doing? Were they sitting down
to supper now without her? She wondered if her silver mug had
been filled with nice rich milk as usual, and if there was toast
to-night for supper. Perhaps Honor was cooking something on the
chafing-dish, as she did sometimes by way of a great treat. Sophy
did wish that she was there. She was so hungry and it was so far!
It seemed as if she must keep walking all night in order to reach
there.</p>
<p>At last, quite exhausted, she sat down upon a rock by the
roadside. She must rest for a few <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>moments at the foot of the long hill
which loomed up before her. There was a little house at the top,
she knew, and a short distance farther on their own place began,
although their house was a half-mile beyond. She had just made up
her mind to continue her weary march, when she saw two young men
or boys emerge from the woods from the other side of the road
from those in which she had been. She was sitting in the shadow
of some large bushes, and she thought if she kept very still that
they might not notice her. She scarcely dared to breathe, but she
heard very distinctly the beating of her heart, and the sound
frightened her. As the boys approached, she heard one of them
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yer won&rsquo;t tell me nothin&rsquo;? Well,
then, yer don&rsquo;t git any of the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; replied the other, as
they passed her.</p>
<p>To Sophy&rsquo;s astonishment, she recognized the voice as
that of Dave Carney. Was it&mdash;could it possibly be he? She
peered after him, and then springing to her feet she ran as fast
as she could up the road in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave! Dave!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Wait for me! <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>I&rsquo;m
lost, and I&rsquo;m so glad to see you. Oh, <i>so</i>
glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then to Carney&rsquo;s astonishment a small hand was
thrust into his hand, and a small and anxious face was turned up
towards his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo; he asked,
stopping abruptly in his walk, while his companion uttered an
exclamation of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the woods with Peter, and I got lost. There
was a terrible scream, and it frightened me dreadfully, and
I&rsquo;ve been all this time trying to find my way home. Oh,
Dave, I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad to see you!&rdquo; said the child,
forgetting her fatigue, and dancing with glee, while she still
tightly grasped his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how
dreadful it was. Who is that, Dave? Is it your brother? He looks
just like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter who I am,&rdquo; said the stranger, roughly.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no use for yer, that&rsquo;s one thing,
sure. Now just yer remember, Dave! yer can&rsquo;t work yer pious
notions on me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do as I like. I&rsquo;ve been
crooked a good long time, now, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll stay crooked.
Yer was as crooked yerself once, an&rsquo; I guess yer are yet,
only yer find it don&rsquo;t pay just at the present time.
I&rsquo;ll <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>leave yer here,&rdquo; he added with an oath, and
suddenly disappeared among the trees by the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surely can&rsquo;t be your brother, Dave,&rdquo;
said Sophy, disapprovingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way he
talks, at all. I&rsquo;m glad he went away. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad
I saw you, though! I don&rsquo;t feel half as tired
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave said little,&mdash;he was a lad of few words,&mdash;but
he held the little girl&rsquo;s hand and helped her over the
rough or the steep places in the road; and at last they were in
sight of the house, and the light which shone from an upper
window seemed like a beacon of hope to the little wanderer.</p>
<p>And presently she was in the house, with Honor&rsquo;s arms
about her, and Katherine taking her hat and coat, while Victoria
ran to the barn, calling to Peter that she was found. He and
Victoria had been to the place in the woods where he had left
her, and then had come back to get lanterns, and to ask some
neighbors to join in the search. The brother and sisters had been
quite beside themselves with anxiety, and their joy and relief
when Sophy appeared was almost too great for words.</p>
<p>As for Sophy herself, she felt amply repaid for <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>her fatigue
and fear when she found herself the centre of importance. She was
led in state to the supper table, she was helped before any of
the others with the choicest viands, including an egg which B.
Lafferty cooked in a little dish especially for her, and brought
to her with much circumstance, and, crowning feature of the
occasion, a vase of wild flowers which Katherine had gathered
that afternoon was placed beside her plate.</p>
<p>When her appetite was somewhat appeased, Sophy recounted her
adventures, and even Peter refrained from condemning her with
cold criticism, when she described her fear of the snake which
had &ldquo;stuck out its tongue at her.&rdquo; In fact, she was
in every sense of the word the heroine of the evening, and it was
so unusual an experience that she could not help enjoying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Dave had been,&rdquo; remarked Honor.
&ldquo;It was odd that he should have come along just at the
right moment for you, Sophy. I am perfectly thankful that he did.
Do you suppose that was his brother, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Peter, as he helped
himself to toast, and proceeded to butter it with a lavish <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>hand.
&ldquo;Carney&rsquo;s got a brother, only he never says much
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, it is very bad form to spread butter on your
bread or your toast like that!&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;You
ought to put it on just where you are going to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Who cares for form?&rdquo; demanded Peter,
crunching his toast with an air of distinct enjoyment.
&ldquo;What I want is taste, not form, Miss K. R.
Starr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really tastes better Katherine&rsquo;s way,&rdquo;
remarked Victoria, &ldquo;if you have never tried it; but
don&rsquo;t change on our account, for the world! By the way, the
people are really moving into the house on the hill. I saw some
wagon loads of furniture going up there to-day. I do hope we
shall like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that it makes any difference whether
we like them or not,&rdquo; said Honor. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t
see anything of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not, Honor?&rdquo; asked Katherine. &ldquo;They
are going to be very near neighbors, and I can&rsquo;t see why,
if they are nice people, we shouldn&rsquo;t be neighborly to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father always liked us to be neighborly to our <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>neighbors,
even if he didn&rsquo;t go about much himself,&rdquo; added
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very different then,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t working for our living. Those people, if
they are rich and don&rsquo;t know anything about us, will
probably look down upon us, and I shall never expose myself to
anything of that sort. No indeed. Let us keep to ourselves as
much as we can, and to the old friends who know about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am interested in them anyhow,&rdquo; said
Victoria. &ldquo;There are a father and mother and two children,
I believe, and the boy&rsquo;s name is Roger. I hope it will be
some one for Peter. I heard all that from the postmistress, in
case you want to know my authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t gossip with the postmistress,
Vic,&rdquo; said Honor, with some severity. &ldquo;It seems to me
it is a queer thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked her sister, imperturbably.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s known me and I&rsquo;ve known her all my life.
Why shouldn&rsquo;t we have a little agreeable conversation
together when I go for the letters? She told me this morning when
she handed me Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s postal card saying she was
coming to see us next week, that she guessed&mdash;the <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>postmistress guessed, I mean&mdash;that my Aunt Ward
would be out here before long. Now that shows that she is a
clever woman, as well as an honest one, for Aunt Sophia had only
signed her initials, S.S.W,&rsquo; and yet she knew right away
who it was from. And it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary for her to
let me know she had read the postal card, was it? So that was
very honest. Oh, I like her, and she tells me a lot I want to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NEW NEIGHBORS ON THE HILL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wentworth Ward</span>, true to the
word written upon her postal card, appeared at Glen Arden early
in the ensuing week. Upon this occasion she made known to her
nieces her intention of spending the greater part of the next
five months at Glen Arden, and naturally this announcement was
received with some dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have some one with you part of the year, at
least,&rdquo; said their aunt, &ldquo;and it suits me to come
here. I had thought of going abroad for the summer, and of taking
one of you with me, but there are various matters of importance
which must be attended to, and which will suffer frightfully if I
am not here to look after them. It is necessary for me to be near
town. I shall board with you, of course. I may just as well pay
the money to you that I should at a hotel at Magnolia or Nahant,
and I don&rsquo;t care for the sea this year. And I am sure you
must be in <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>need of the money. I can&rsquo;t imagine how you manage
to get along on so little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor ignored the close of this speech, and politely expressed
her pleasure at the prospect of such an extended visit from her
aunt, though it is to be feared that her tone was not very
hearty. She was the only one of the family who could see her,
Katherine being in the schoolroom, and Victoria and Peter at
school in Fordham. This was one of Mrs. Wentworth Ward&rsquo;s
customs which her nieces considered most aggravating. She
invariably came to Glen Arden during school hours, and expected
their undivided attention.</p>
<p>Though she paid close observance to her own engagements, she
had small regard for those of other people, and her nieces&rsquo;
methods of supporting themselves she could never be induced to
take seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first of May will be next Thursday, a week from
to-day,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;and I shall come on the
three o&rsquo;clock train. You may give me your father&rsquo;s
old room. It was mine when I lived here, you know, and I like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Honor, remembering that Katherine
now occupied the room, and <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>wondering what she would say to
being turned out. &ldquo;And is there anything else you would
like, Aunt Sophia? I think perhaps I had better get another cook,
and let B. Laf&mdash;I mean Blanch&mdash;do the upstairs work.
She is not a very superior cook, and with such a large family we
shall need two servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will bring my waitress, Ellen Higgins, who has been
with me so long,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Ward, briskly. &ldquo;I
intended to suggest it, and she is an excellent cook herself, and
can give Blanch&mdash;extraordinary name for an Irishwoman,
Honor!&mdash;she can give Blanch lessons in cooking. I will also,
and there are a number of other things that I want to teach you.
Therefore you may expect me in the 3 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> train on Thursday, the first day of
May. I shall bring my own desk, and my two canaries, my
typewriter, and a number of other little things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a typewriter,&rdquo; said Honor, somewhat
appalled by this list. &ldquo;Perhaps you could use it, and not
bring your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a typewriter? Where did you get it, and whose
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Katherine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;Indeed! And does she use it with
ease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; faltered Honor, who felt
all too surely that she had made a misstep, and perhaps a fatal
one. What would their aunt say if she knew that they had owned a
typewriter for nearly six months, and that not one of them could
make use of it? And she would find it out, she surely would! Why,
oh why, had Honor ever given her this superfluous bit of
information? Without it she need never have known that there was
such a thing in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I shall not bring my own,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Wentworth Ward, rising as she spoke. &ldquo;On the contrary,
I will engage Katherine to be my secretary, and of course she
will prefer to use her own machine which she is accustomed to.
You tell her, will you, Honor, that I shall pay her an ample
salary. And now good-bye, my dear! It will really be very
pleasant to be with you all. My love to the others. I am not
going to take the train yet. The carriage that is waiting will
carry me down to Fordham, where I have a meeting.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a moment she was gone. Honor stood on the piazza,
looking at the back of the carriage <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>as it rolled up the avenue. One more
week, and then, good-bye, indeed! It would be the end of their
careless freedom, their independence, their good times. For
although it had been a sad winter in many ways, although they had
missed the dear father more than words could express, although
the question of money had at times pressed heavily upon them, yet
in spite of all they had been happy with one another, they had
enjoyed the sense of independence which they had gained from the
fact that they were supporting, or trying to support, themselves,
and there had been intense satisfaction in the mere feeling that
they were earning money. Little though it was, it was theirs by
the right of labor, and Honor was proud of it.</p>
<p>To be sure, they should now earn more, for she knew that her
aunt would pay them generously; but she saw an endless line of
small vexations rising and stretching themselves through the
summer, the little trials that are not much in themselves, but
which, when they come in rapid succession, are wearing and
annoying, to say the least. Katherine, for one, would not brook
the interference which was sure to come from her <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>aunt. And
what would she say to being obliged to give up her room, and to
being engaged as secretary and typewriter?</p>
<p>Depressed and disturbed though she was feeling, Honor laughed
aloud at the thought of the wonders which Katherine was expected
to perform upon her writing-machine. As far as her present
knowledge went she might just as well be required to translate
something from the Sanscrit.</p>
<p>And then, Honor, after one more look across the lawn where her
father&rsquo;s dear trees were in full leaf now, and the grass
was green, and the robins were hopping about in ecstasy over the
coming of spring, left the piazza and went back to the
schoolroom. She determined to say nothing of these plans of her
Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s until Victoria should come home. It was
curious, said Honor to herself, that they were all growing to
lean upon Victoria.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was not until the afternoon, when they had a few
moments of leisure before Katherine should go to one of her music
pupils, that Honor imparted to them her dire intelligence.</p>
<p>It had precisely the effect which she had feared. <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Katherine
flatly declined to give up her room to her aunt, and declared
that it was an imposition to have her come there at all. She, for
one, refused to endure it. As to acting as her secretary, it was
out of the question. Besides, she could not use the typewriter.
Why had Honor ever led Aunt Sophia to suppose that she could?
Honor had drawn them into this scrape; now she must get them out
of it. She need not have told Aunt Sophia that they owned a
typewriter.</p>
<p>Katherine walked up and down the shady end of the piazza,
looking very tall and extremely angry. Indignation was written in
every line of her beautiful face. She had, oddly enough, the
perfectly straight features of the aunt whom she did not
particularly love; but her eyes and hair were very dark and her
forehead was low and broad. It would have annoyed her extremely
to be told that she looked like Mrs. Wentworth Ward, who,
nevertheless, was a handsome woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no way out of it,&rdquo; said Honor. She was
sitting in the hammock, and swung herself to and fro while she
watched Katherine&rsquo;s rapid movements. Victoria had perched
herself upon the railing of the piazza, and was looking out
across the lawn.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;And, Katherine, you bought the typewriter. You
are responsible for its being in the house, so I really
don&rsquo;t think you ought to blame me for this complication. I
know it was foolish of me ever to tell Aunt Sophia, but I was so
taken aback when I heard that she was coming for five months, and
was going to bring all those things with her, including that
patronizing Ellen Higgins, whom I can&rsquo;t bear, that I said
the first thing that came into my head. I thought if she used
ours,&mdash;yours, I mean,&mdash;it would be one thing less to
bring with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you took the news so
meekly,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
her right up and down that she couldn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course Honor couldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said
Victoria. &ldquo;It would have been very rude, and, besides,
Katherine, she is our own aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, you can give up your room to her, and
you can be her secretary. It is easy for you to say we ought to
have her here, for you don&rsquo;t have to do anything. I have to
give up my dear room, which I love because it was father&rsquo;s,
and go to that hot third-story one, I suppose. As for the
typewriter, it is simply out of the question. <a

can&rsquo;t use it, and I won&rsquo;t learn to use it just to
please Aunt Sophia; and if Honor is going to keep flinging it in
my face, she can keep on flinging, that is all. And now it is
time for me to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up her music case and was soon walking rapidly away
from them across the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do about it?&rdquo; sighed Honor.
&ldquo;I knew Katherine would be frantic, and I suppose it is
provoking for her, but I don&rsquo;t see why she need be so
furious with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind!&rdquo; said Victoria, looking after
Katherine&rsquo;s hurrying figure. &ldquo;Katherine&rsquo;s bark
is worse than her bite, you know, and she will probably have
gotten over some of it, before she comes back. I am sorry for her
scholars, though, this afternoon! But, Honor, I have an
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Vic? If it is a cheering one, as I suppose
it is, do hurry and tell me, for I feel bowed to the earth with
gloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will learn to use the typewriter, and I will be Aunt
Sophia&rsquo;s secretary through the summer. I have been wild to
try it, but I have had so much to do, I couldn&rsquo;t. I will
learn to use it before she comes and practise on it in secret,
after she gets here, and by the time school is <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>over, I
shall be ready for work. She can&rsquo;t expect any of us to do
it before June, while we are so busy, and we can make
Katherine&rsquo;s music an excuse for her not to do it at all.
She will have to practise very hard through the summer, we can
say. You write a nice note to Aunt Sophia and tell her how it is,
so that she may be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Vic, what a dear you are! You do help me out of so
many difficulties. Do you really think, though, that you can
learn to use it in so short a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Victoria. &ldquo;One can do
anything one sets out to do, if one only tries, and I mean to
conquer that white elephant of a typewriter, if only for the sake
of feeling that the forty dollars wasn&rsquo;t wasted; and then,
too, if Aunt Sophia pays me well, it will be quite a nice sum for
us to make. I will go tinker at it now, for I have a little time,
and those books of lessons are quite a help. So, cheer up, Honor!
We may get some fun out of Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s visit, after
all.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath
way,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>she hummed, as she went into the house and sought the hitherto
neglected writing-machine.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>In
the meantime, Katherine pursued her way across the fields to the
village, where she intended to take an electric car. She was
still very angry and greatly irritated by her late conversation,
and by the prospect of five months of Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s
uninterrupted society. How hateful it was that they were so poor
that they were forced to submit to the imposition, as she termed
it. If Aunt Sophia were coming as a visitor, it would be
different, but as a boarder she would, no doubt, consider herself
privileged to say and do exactly what she wished, and how could
she be expected to give up her room to her? And besides all this,
as Katherine really felt guilty about the purchase of the
typewriter, every word that Honor spoke upon the subject went
home.</p>
<p>After a while, however, her better nature prevailed. It was
always thus with Katherine, as her sisters knew. If sufficient
time were given her, she was sure to come out of her fits of
temper in the sweetest possible frame of mind, so repentant for
all that she had said, and so desirous to atone for it, that it
was impossible to help loving her more than ever. On this
occasion, before she had reached Fordham she had <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>begun to be
sorry, and by the time she had returned to the village, after
giving two music lessons, she was ready to do all and more than
her sisters required of her.</p>
<p>She left the electric car at the post-office and found there
several letters for the family; and then, the afternoon being so
beautiful, she concluded to walk home by a somewhat indirect way,
one which led her past the entrance to the house on the hill, as
the Starrs had been in the habit of calling it. This house was a
handsome one which had been vacant for two years. The grounds
about it were not extensive, but they had always been well kept
until the death of the owner. Since then they had been somewhat
neglected; but now the place had been rented, and Katherine was
glad to see, as she approached, that men were at work on the lawn
and on the avenue which led up a rather steep incline to the
house.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment to watch them, and then remembering
that the family were probably already there, she hurried on,
hoping that she had not been seen. She had not gone more than a
few yards, however, before she heard a footstep behind and a
voice said:</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;Miss Starr, I beg your pardon, but is not this
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, Katherine saw a lady, who held towards her a
letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you ever so much!&rdquo; said Katherine.
&ldquo;I slipped them into my music case at the post-office. I
wonder if any more have dropped out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling in a
friendly way which won Katherine&rsquo;s heart upon the spot.
&ldquo;I have been behind you all the way, and this did not fall
until just as you reached our place. I couldn&rsquo;t help seeing
the address on it, and so I knew you were one of the Miss Starrs,
whom we have heard so much about and are so anxious to meet. I
hope you are going to be very neighborly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; said Katherine, cordially. She was
charmed with the lady&rsquo;s manner, and quite forgot
Honor&rsquo;s intention to have nothing to do with the newcomers.
&ldquo;We will come and call upon you very soon. You are Mrs.
Madison, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mrs., but Miss,&rdquo; corrected her new friend,
again with the lovely smile that had so attracted <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>the young
girl. She was a beautiful woman, with fair hair and eyes of deep
blue, and there was that in her face which won Katherine&rsquo;s
love at first sight. She felt that she had found a friend, and,
with all the enthusiasm of her young and ardent nature, she loved
her before she knew her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Margaret Madison. I think you must be the
musical one, as you have a familiar-looking roll in your hand.
You must come and see my music-room. I play the violin myself,
and I should so much enjoy playing with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine&rsquo;s dark eyes grew round with excitement and the
color deepened in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The violin!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And you want
me to accompany you? How perfectly lovely it will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have some good music,&rdquo; said Miss
Madison; &ldquo;you on the piano, and I on the violin. And my
brother sings a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your brother!&rdquo; said Katherine.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you have a brother, for we were hoping
that he would do for Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Madison looked somewhat astonished at this remark, but
she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter is my brother,&rdquo; continued Katherine, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>&ldquo;and
he doesn&rsquo;t care for many boys, so I do hope your brother
and he will get on together. We were so glad when we heard that
another boy was coming. My sisters and I will call upon you very
soon. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not notice that Miss Madison laughed outright as she
left her, so excited was she at the tempting prospect held out to
her of the music which was to be enjoyed. She hurried home to
tell her sisters of the meeting, and to beg Honor to reconsider
her determination to have nothing to do with the new neighbors,
but to go at once to call, and in the same breath she assured
them that Aunt Sophia could have her room and she would try to
use the typewriter.</p>
<p>She was greatly relieved, however, when her sisters told her
that her last offer was unnecessary. Victoria had succeeded so
well with her first efforts that she felt quite enthusiastic
about it and would on no account give up the position to
Katherine.</p>
<p>At first Honor would not listen to the suggestion that they
should call upon the Madisons. It was only after much urging from
both Katherine and Victoria that she finally consented; and then
she took pains to make it very clear to them that she <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>would go
chiefly and solely because she wanted Peter to have a companion,
and as there was a brother there who would no doubt be a
desirable boy for him to know, it would perhaps prevent
awkwardness for them to become acquainted with the other members
of the family. The next afternoon, therefore, was set apart for
making the visit.</p>
<p>This formality devolved naturally upon Honor and Katherine,
but at the last moment Victoria announced that she should
accompany them, so anxious was she to see the music-room and the
other interesting things which were sure to be there, as well as
the beautiful Miss Madison herself, of whom Katherine had talked
so enthusiastically ever since she had met her the day
before.</p>
<p>The three sisters made ready for their call, and before long
were climbing the steep hill. They were about to ring the bell,
when the door was opened for them by Miss Madison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you coming,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I thought
I would let you in myself. How good of you to come so soon. I am
delighted to see you. Now you must tell me which is Honor and
which is Katherine and which Victoria,&rdquo; she added as she <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>shook hands
with each. &ldquo;You see I know all your names though I
don&rsquo;t know you apart. Come into the house, and I will send
for my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the parlor, and as they did so a gentleman rose
and came forward. He was a good-looking young man with blue eyes
like Miss Madison&rsquo;s, though his hair was darker than hers.
Before the girls had time to wonder who he was their hostess
introduced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my brother Roger,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do
you think he will &lsquo;do for Peter&rsquo;?&rdquo; she added,
laughing as she turned to Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Katherine, wanting to laugh
herself, but fearing that Honor would be shocked; &ldquo;what
must you have thought of me yesterday! We were told that he was a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am in a great many respects,&rdquo; said Roger
Madison. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;do for
Peter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, what had become of Victoria? She had paused
for a moment in the doorway and then had turned and disappeared.
Her one thought was flight, and like a flash she ran down the
avenue and was lost to sight beneath the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>Miss Madison&rsquo;s brother was the man who had bought the
etching! What would Honor say?</p>
<h2><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VICTORIA DECIDES TO KEEP IT
SECRET.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> would Honor say? This was
Victoria&rsquo;s chief thought as she rushed headlong down the
hill, not pausing until she had reached the safe shelter of their
own place. There beneath one of the old trees she found a rustic
bench, and sinking down upon it, quite breathless from her run,
she tried to consider calmly the situation.</p>
<p>What would Honor say? She who had hoped that they might never
see the young man again because in her eyes the affair had been
so mortifying! And so it had been, Victoria said to herself. What
would Mr. Madison himself think when he learned that one of his
new neighbors was actually the girl whom he had encountered in a
Boston picture store peddling her wares, and of whom he had
bought something purely as an act of charity?</p>
<p>Victoria, looking back at the occurrence, felt perfectly
confident that it was chiefly owing to his good nature that he
had bought the etching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/sv4.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>He
was sorry, probably, for a girl who was forced to do such a
thing, and had given her an extra five or ten dollars merely out
of charity. Victoria writhed in spirit.</p>
<p>She did not regret her expedition to Boston, for they had been
in sore need of the money, and to part with the pictures and the
jewelry had been a perfectly honorable means of getting it. She
did not feel in the least degree ashamed of having sold the
etchings, but she was deeply mortified when she remembered that
she had allowed herself to accept the higher price from one who
was a complete stranger to her, and one who certainly did appear
to be sorry for her.</p>
<p>The Starr family pride&mdash;of which this daughter of the
house had no small share&mdash;was up in arms. She felt that she
could never look Roger Madison in the face. That he would
remember her as clearly as she remembered him, she had not the
smallest doubt.</p>
<p>And then again, what would Honor say? She would probably
flatly refuse to have anything more to do with the Madisons,
which would be unfortunate, for Katherine had set her heart upon
the anticipated music that she was to enjoy with Miss <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Madison.
Katherine was of an ardent temperament, and her likings were as
strong and unchangeable as her dislikes. Already she loved and
admired Miss Madison with all the enthusiasm at her command, and
it would be a bitter disappointment to her if Honor should decree
that the two families were to have no further intercourse.
Indeed, Katherine would in all probability decline to listen to
Honor, and that would make trouble. What should be done to avert
these consequences?</p>
<p>There was but one course to pursue, and that was to keep her
family in ignorance of the fact that she had ever seen Roger
Madison before. Victoria fairly gasped as this solution of the
difficulty presented itself. Could she keep such a secret? The
sisters were in the habit of talking freely together and of
telling one another all the events both large and small that came
into their day. Not to make known to Honor and Katherine the fact
that Victoria had met Mr. Madison before, and under the peculiar
circumstances which had made the incident a matter of family
history, required some determination. It meant far more to her
than it would to many another girl. To <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Victoria it
seemed like an act of deliberate deception, and she hesitated
before taking the step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to deceive them, I am sure,&rdquo;
she said to herself, as she sat under the trees this beautiful
afternoon in the last week of April, looking with troubled eyes
towards the house on the hill; &ldquo;but it does seem a pity to
deprive Katherine of the music, and if Honor knows about it, she
will probably be almost rude to the Madisons, for she will be so
anxious to show her pride about it, and that seems a pity, for
they are so pleasant and evidently want to be friendly. I can
keep out of Mr. Madison&rsquo;s way, and perhaps it will be a
long time before he discovers me. I wish I had some older person
to ask. I wish I had a mother. It must be so lovely to have one
to go to whenever anything troublesome comes up. I wonder if
girls who have mothers realize how terrible it is not to have
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s mind wandered from her present anxiety to the
thought of the mother who had died when Sophy was a baby. She had
been only seven years old herself at the time, but she remembered
her perfectly, and the change which it had made in her father. He
had become so <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>grave and quiet after that, and although he was always
devoted to his children, he was different, Honor always said,
from what he had been before. Honor had tried so faithfully to be
a mother to the younger ones, thought Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then Honor is really so little older than I am,
that sometimes it seems as if she didn&rsquo;t know a great deal
more herself. If only Aunt Sophia were different! But she would
be no help. No, I must decide for myself and&mdash;<i>I decide to
keep it a secret</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria said the last few words aloud, with slow and
deliberate emphasis. Then she rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must they have thought of me, running away in that
style? And what shall I say to the girls? I shall just have to
tell them that I was overwhelmed with shyness just as we were
going into the room. They won&rsquo;t believe me, because
I&rsquo;m not often shy, but I am sure it was the truth. I was
frightened to pieces. What a time I shall have making up excuses
for not going there, or seeing Mr. Madison if he comes
here&mdash;if he comes! Very probably he won&rsquo;t. And I must
be careful about the trains. It would be awkward enough to meet
him at our little station. Dear me, what a summer it is going to
be! Aunt Sophia at Glen Arden, <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>and the man who bought the etching
in the house on the hill!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath way,<br
/>
And merrily hent the stile&mdash;a!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will divert my mind by working in the garden a little. Or
no, I will practise on the typewriter! If I don&rsquo;t learn to
do it easily soon, Aunt Sophia will suspect the plot. How many
secrets we&rsquo;re having now. I don&rsquo;t mind having them
from Aunt Sophia, but I do hate to have anything on my mind that
Honor and Katherine are not to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not been long at work before she heard footsteps upon
the piazza, and the voices of her two sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose Vic can be?&rdquo; Honor was
saying. &ldquo;I really feel quite anxious about her. Vic, are
you here?&rdquo; she called, coming into the house. &ldquo;Why,
child, what happened to you? Here she is, Katherine, working on
the typewriter. What made you run away, Vic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shy,&rdquo; replied Victoria, as she slowly fingered
the keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;It was
something else, Vic. You never were shy in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;Frightened, then,&rdquo; said Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightened? What at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Madison&rsquo;s big brother.&rdquo; Which was
certainly the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic, how absurd!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;He is
just as nice as he can be. Wasn&rsquo;t it too ridiculous that we
should have supposed that he was a small boy of Peter&rsquo;s
age? We had a great laugh over it, and I was really glad that we
had made the mistake, for it was such a joke it quite broke the
ice. I feel as if I had known them both for years, don&rsquo;t
you, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are very nice, both of them,&rdquo; replied
her sister, &ldquo;and I am very glad, girls, that you made me go
there to call. After all, it would have been silly to hold aloof
from them just because we are poor. I don&rsquo;t think they are
at all the kind to look down on us because we
are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Katherine with some
impatience. &ldquo;They are true gentle-people, and not in the
least snobbish. The mother is lovely, Vic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria bent over her machine, examining the result of her
labor. She was indeed glad that she had decided not to divulge
her secret, now that she <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>heard what a pleasant impression the
new neighbors had made, especially upon Honor; but she wished
that she were at liberty to enjoy their society herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing this quite nicely,&rdquo; said she, taking
out the paper and showing it to her sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Katherine. &ldquo;I
had no idea you would learn so quickly, though you have spelled
some of these words in a new and rather remarkable way. But, Vic,
how funny you are! You were wild to have us call on the Madisons,
and apparently most anxious to go there yourself, and now you
seem to take so little interest in them, and you rushed away
after you were actually in the house. It was a frightfully rude
thing to do, and they didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. Honor
and I had the greatest time explaining to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo; asked Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we said that you were very busy, as you were still
at school, and had probably remembered some lesson, or something
that you hadn&rsquo;t done. We were perfectly at a loss to know
what to say, weren&rsquo;t we, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was really rude, Vic. I think you <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>ought to
apologize to Miss Madison. You had better go there very soon and
explain, though I can&rsquo;t imagine what you are going to tell
her. It will be rather peculiar to say that you were frightened.
They are coming here very soon and perhaps you can make it right
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them?&rdquo; asked Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only Miss Madison and her brother. Mrs. Madison is
an invalid and doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere, but they are
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria groaned in spirit, but she made no audible comment,
and presently her sisters left her. She would now have a
difficult road to travel, she said to herself. She must watch
with increasing vigilance and promptly disappear if there was the
slightest chance of meeting Roger Madison. She was leaning back
in her chair, pondering the situation, her brow puckered by the
deep thought in which she was engaged, when Peter entered the
room, followed closely by Sophy and Sirius.</p>
<p>Since the day last week when he had deserted Sophy in the
woods Peter had been unusually attentive to his small sister. He
had said little upon the subject, but he had thought about it,
and he undoubtedly felt some remorse for his share in <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the events
of that afternoon. It was very stupid of Sophy to have allowed
herself to lose her way, he thought, but then she was only a girl
and a little one at that. What else could one expect of so
benighted an individual? And he was fond of Sophy after a
fashion, he said to himself with superb condescension, and was
sorry that she had been frightened. Therefore he had allowed her
to bear him company more constantly than usual during the past
few days, and Sophy was in the seventh heaven of delight in
consequence.</p>
<p>At the present moment they were engaged in a spirited
discussion, which was not uncommon, or, to be more exact, Peter
was in the act of laying down the law to Sophy, this being one of
his favorite pastimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a perfect little goose, Sophy! I can&rsquo;t
imagine what you are thinking of. A wheelwright! I told you the
other day what I was going to do. Have you forgotten already?
Your memory isn&rsquo;t worth a cent. But what else can you
expect of a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy became visibly depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could remember, Peter,&rdquo; she said,
searching in the depths of her memory for Peter&rsquo;s <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>words of
wisdom too precious to be lost. &ldquo;Did you tell me long
ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long ago, at all. It was the day you got scared in
the woods. If you remember, don&rsquo;t say anything, for Vic is
here, and you know it&rsquo;s a secret. Don&rsquo;t you know the
thing that&rsquo;s going to have nothing about girls? Well, no
matter. All the less chance of the secret&rsquo;s getting out if
you&rsquo;ve forgotten it. What do you suppose Sophy wants me to
be, when I&rsquo;m grown up, Vic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;A
clergyman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. The most ridiculous thing you ever heard
of: a wheelwright!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wheelwright?&rdquo; repeated Victoria. &ldquo;Where
in the world did you get that idea, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy looked ready to cry. She felt that it was hard, indeed,
that even her beloved Vic should question her sagacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only meant because it&rsquo;s so safe,&rdquo; she
faltered. &ldquo;I do want Peter to do something he won&rsquo;t
be killed in. I didn&rsquo;t think about the clergyman. He could
be that, of course, and not be killed. But my history lesson this
morning was all about wars and battles, and I felt so worried
about Peter, <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>in case he should be a soldier or a sailor when he
grows up. The soldiers get shot, and the sailors get drownded,
and I was thinking of the safest thing he could be, and it was a
wheelwright. They just have to mend wagons and carriages; and
Peter likes to mend things up in the shop, you know. It is safer
than a blacksmith, for a horse might kick a blacksmith, you know,
and perhaps kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter roared with laughter, and even Victoria had to raise her
hand to her mouth to hide a smile; but she saw that Sophy was
very much in earnest, and she would not hurt her feelings for the
world. Peter&rsquo;s laugh, however, was the finishing touch.
Sophy hid her face in her sister&rsquo;s lap, and her small
shoulders shook with sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re real mean!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I only
want to save your life. You&rsquo;re my only brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria frowned fiercely at Peter while she endeavored to
soothe Sophy, and Peter himself felt a little remorseful for his
unfeeling mirth. He attempted to mend matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m laughing at Sirius!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he too absurd? Sirius, you ridiculous dog, ha!
ha! ha! Oh, Sophy&mdash;I mean Sirius, how funny you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Upon
which Sirius in his turn was sorely offended. With lowered tail
and with an appearance of great dejection, he crept under the
sofa. Like the rest of his race he disliked being laughed at, and
he felt that he had done nothing to subject himself to such an
insult. He had been lying at his master&rsquo;s feet, quite sound
asleep, and no doubt enjoying the dream of an entrancing walk in
the woods, when he had been recalled to real life by this
extravagant burst of laughter mingled with the sound of his own
name. Truly he had a right to feel aggrieved. And sitting in the
most remote corner beneath the sofa he thought over his
wrongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, your idea is not such a bad one,
Sophy,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;You are quite right about it
being better for Peter to do something safe; but I don&rsquo;t
think wheelwrights make a great deal of money, and as Peter is
the only man in our family, it is rather necessary that he should
earn as much as possible. By the way, Peter, do you know where
Dave is this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t find him. He must be off
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose he goes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said
Peter, indifferently. &ldquo;Perhaps he goes down to see his
people in Fordham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he goes to walk with that brother,&rdquo;
suggested Sophy, who had dried her eyes and quickly recovered
from her recent mortification. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a nice
brother, though, and he talked regular swear-words. I
shouldn&rsquo;t think Dave would like him to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither should I,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;and I
wish he wouldn&rsquo;t go off so much. I think Honor had better
speak to him. Even though we have another man at work, he needs
Dave&rsquo;s help if we are going to make anything out of the
vegetables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had determined to turn their garden to account this
summer, and to send their vegetables and perhaps some of their
fruit to the markets for sale. They had engaged a gardener for
the purpose, and although his wages took a large slice of their
earnings, they had decided after consulting with Mr. Abbott that
it would be a wise thing to do. Mr. Abbott had been ill the
greater part of the winter and had been unable to come to Glen
Arden for several months, but his wards heard from him
frequently, and they <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>seldom undertook any important
project without asking his advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak to Honor about it now,&rdquo; continued
Victoria. &ldquo;Come, Sophy! Come with me, and then we&rsquo;ll
go down to the garden afterwards and see how things are going
there. Fortunately it is Friday, so we have no lessons to
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Peter to conciliate the offended Sirius as best he
could, Victoria and Sophy went upstairs.</p>
<p>The following week passed quickly enough, and all too soon
came the day before that on which Mrs. Wentworth Ward was to
descend upon them. Katherine, in spite of the entreaties of her
sisters, had deferred until the last possible moment her removal
to another room. At length, however, further delay became out of
the question, and on Wednesday evening she announced that she
should begin to remove her effects to the third story if her
family would assist in the operation.</p>
<p>Peter and Victoria had each offered to take the third-story
apartment and give either of theirs on the second floor to
Katherine if she desired, <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>but she had finally decided that she
preferred to go up herself. There were two rooms there with a
square hall between, and she rather fancied the idea of having a
whole suite to herself, where she would be quite free from
interruption or criticism. It was not probable that her Aunt
Sophia would often mount those steep stairs, she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get everything moved up to-night, B. Lafferty can
clean my room to-morrow, and it will be all ready for our dear
aunt by the time she arrives,&rdquo; said Katherine. So after
supper the four girls ascended and began the task of
&ldquo;moving&rdquo; Katherine.</p>
<p>Peter took no part in the proceedings, but retired to the
&ldquo;shop,&rdquo; where he had some work in which he was
interested. Very soon they were all actively engaged, one
carrying skirts and hats, another staggering under a pile of
boxes, still another rummaging in the depths of the closet,
bringing to light all sorts of things which Katherine had stowed
away there in some remote period of the past, and had apparently
forgotten. Occasionally Honor or Victoria would pause in dismay
as some new article appeared which they did not know that
Katherine possessed.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>&ldquo;Where did you get that, Katherine?&rdquo; they
asked more than once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I bought it a long time ago, when we had more
money. Not this winter of course, girls. I really thought I
needed it at the time, and it is so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy enjoyed the experience to the utmost. She had always
longed to investigate Katherine&rsquo;s possessions, which she
knew to be more interesting than those of her other sisters, but
she had never hitherto been allowed this privilege. Now that the
desired opportunity had come, she determined to make the most of
it. Unheeded by her busy sisters, she sat on the floor and
explored box after box of ribbons, and odds and ends of finery,
feeling that at last the millennium was here.</p>
<p>It occurred to Victoria&rsquo;s frugal mind, as she glanced
from the gallery to the hall below during one of her trips to the
third story, that it was scarcely worth while to have so much
light downstairs, as there was no one there to make use of it.
Surely it was extravagant to burn so much oil unnecessarily, so
without mentioning it to the others, who would have been sure to
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>expostulate, she ran down and put out the lamps, at the
same time bolting the front door and attending to the fastenings
of the windows. Then she went upstairs again and continued her
work.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the sound of the door-bell was heard through
the house. Sirius, who had been lying at the head of the stairs,
broke into loud and furious barking and rushed to the front door.
The girls looked at one another in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be at this hour?&rdquo; exclaimed Honor.
&ldquo;It must be very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a little after eight,&rdquo; said Victoria,
&ldquo;and all the lights are out downstairs! Hurry and fix
yourselves up, girls! Blanch, Blanch, wait!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in an agitated whisper as the maid&rsquo;s heavy footsteps were
heard in the hall below. Victoria flew down the stairs almost as
quickly as Sirius had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open the door till I light the
lamps,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROGER MADISON TELLS A STORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> did not really take long to
light the lamps, but to Victoria it seemed an age. Matches broke
in her hand as she struck them, her trembling fingers allowed a
chimney to slip from their grasp to be dashed in a thousand atoms
upon the floor, and in the meantime she heard voices upon the
piazza, while Blanch, standing close to the front door, asked her
in loud and penetrating tones if she were not yet ready to have
it opened.</p>
<p>At last, signalling to her that the time had come to admit the
visitors, whoever they might be, Victoria disappeared through the
door which led to the back of the house and listened at its crack
while Blanch drew back the bolts with a clatter and noisily
turned the key in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the young ladies at home?&rdquo; she heard a voice
ask which she felt sure was Miss Madison&rsquo;s. She hoped
devoutly that Blanch&rsquo;s reply would be a <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>discreet
one. Unfortunately Blanch was so apt to be loquacious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, they&rsquo;re home,&rdquo; replied B.
Lafferty, &ldquo;but I guess they&rsquo;ve gone to bed. The
lights was all out, but Miss Vic come down an&rsquo; lit
&rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll see if the others is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria groaned aloud. All her ingenuity had been of no
avail, and Blanch had capped the unfortunate climax by speaking
of her as &ldquo;Miss Vic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have come too late!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Madison. &ldquo;I was afraid that we were. We will come another
time. Don&rsquo;t disturb them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Blanch, affably. &ldquo;Just
as you say, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria felt ready to dart from her hiding-place and detain
the visitors by force, but at that moment Honor&rsquo;s light
step was heard upon the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t gone to bed at all,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;and are delighted to see you. We were upstairs this
evening, and some one put out the lamps by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a man&rsquo;s voice was heard, and Victoria knew that
the dreaded Roger was also there. She hastened up the back stairs
as Katherine in her <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>turn went down the front, and
proceeded to devote herself to finishing the task of the evening,
congratulating herself that she had not been caught.</p>
<p>Sophy meanwhile had disappeared, and Victoria in thinking over
the excitement of the last few minutes completely forgot her. In
fact, she supposed that she was in bed as she usually was at this
hour. The little girl, however, had been engaged in making hay
while the sun shone. In other words, she had retired to the room
which she shared with Victoria, and had taken with her a large
box of treasures which she had abstracted from Katherine&rsquo;s
belongings, in which she proceeded to array herself.</p>
<p>Upon her head she placed a wreath of artificial roses from an
old hat of Katherine&rsquo;s, which, owing to her short hair, it
was a difficult matter to adjust. Finally, however, this was
arranged to her satisfaction, and she then draped about her
shoulders a large white lace scarf, which she fastened at one
side with an immense bow of yellow satin. Katherine when she wore
colors had been fond of brilliant ones, and was constantly buying
all varieties of flowers, ribbons, and what not for her personal
adornment. Just as Sophy had finished thus <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>decking
herself had come the flurry which ensued upon the ringing of the
door-bell, and then the girls had gone down to receive the
visitors.</p>
<p>Sophy had heard so much of these new neighbors during the last
few days that she was most desirous of seeing them. She had
walked past the house on the hill more than once in the hope that
her curiosity might be gratified, but to no avail. Now they were
actually in the house. It was too good an opportunity to let
slip. Shortly after Victoria came up the back stairs, Sophy crept
down by the same route. Softly she opened the door which led to
the front of the house and stealthily she took her way into the
square hall.</p>
<p>A screen usually stood near the door at the back of the
parlor. She hoped that she should find it there now, and that no
one would be sitting at that end of the parlor. In that case she
could peep from behind the screen or perhaps through its crack.
She found to her satisfaction that the screen was there, and that
her sisters with their guests were sitting at the farther end of
the room,&mdash;it was a large one with two doors,&mdash;and she
immediately placed herself in a position from which she fancied
that she could command a view of the room <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>without
being perceived herself. She was also pleased to discover that
her sisters were sitting with their backs to her, while their
visitors faced her. She could thus see exactly what they looked
like.</p>
<p>Mr. Madison was telling Katherine a story. It appeared to be
an interesting tale as well as an amusing one, for Katherine was
laughing heartily, and presently Honor and Miss Madison gave up
their conversation and listened also. Sophy, thinking the crack
unsatisfactory and growing bolder, peered around the corner of
the screen for a second at a time. She found it a fascinating
pursuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Madison continued his story. It was a favorite one with
him, and he had seldom found more appreciative listeners than the
two Miss Starrs. He was approaching his point, leading up to it
with the skill of an accomplished storyteller when&mdash;what was
that? His eye caught something that moved, at the other end of
the room. Probably the dog which had barked upon their arrival
and had since disappeared. He continued his tale, but there it
was again! Surely it was no dog that he saw, but pink roses,
yellow ribbon, white lace, appearing, vanishing, and reappearing
from behind the screen.</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>He
faltered for a moment in the story, and his sister wondered what
was the matter. She looked at him, and then followed his glance.
It was resting upon an extraordinary vision. A small pale face,
with large brown eyes wide open with wonder at the tale, the face
surmounted by a wreath of pink roses, was thrust from behind the
screen. Roger controlled his amusement with difficulty, and
brought the story to an abrupt termination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really true?&rdquo; asked a voice from the back
of the room when the laughter had ceased.</p>
<p>The sisters turned. There stood Sophy in her fantastic
costume, emerging boldly from her hiding-place and bent as usual
upon probing the truth of the story to the core.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sophy!&rdquo; exclaimed Honor and Katherine
together. &ldquo;What are you doing there? What <i>have you</i>
got on? And why aren&rsquo;t you in bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know if that story is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always impossible to turn Sophy from the subject which
at the moment chanced to absorb her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Roger
Madison, <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>laughing, &ldquo;but if you will come over here, I will
tell you one that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy, you ought to be in bed,&rdquo; said Honor,
severely. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what you mean by coming
down to the parlor dressed up in those extraordinary
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they were strordinary, Honor. I
thought they were pretty. They&rsquo;re Kathie&rsquo;s
things,&rdquo; she continued, for the benefit of the visitors,
&ldquo;out of her boxes. We&rsquo;re moving Kathie to the third
story &rsquo;cause Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s coming to-morrow. Kathie
has to give up her room to her, but she doesn&rsquo;t want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy!&rdquo; exclaimed Honor, in a tone of warning,
while the Madisons laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly true, Honor. You know Kathie said at
first she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor rose to her feet, but Katherine concluded that the
better plan would be to laugh off a situation which was rapidly
becoming awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our small
sister has let the cat out of the bag, and we may as well tell
you the rest. Our aunt, Mrs. Wentworth Ward, is coming to-morrow
to stay all summer, and I didn&rsquo;t want to give up my room at
all, but <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>she wanted it and&mdash;well, Aunt Sophia usually has
what she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you were busy to-night,
then,&rdquo; said Miss Madison, who liked Katherine all the
better for her frankness. She was about to say more when
Sophy&rsquo;s solemn voice was again heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kathie, I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. We
haven&rsquo;t any cat. You know we can&rsquo;t have one on
account of Sirius, and so I couldn&rsquo;t possibly let it out of
a bag. I think you&rsquo;re making up a story, Kathie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech was received with such shouts of laughter that
Sophy fled from the room and up to Victoria, who was listening at
the head of the stairs. She had missed Sophy, and, after looking
for her in vain, had finally detected her whereabouts. Now she
received her weeping sister, and led her to the safe seclusion of
their own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are a very interesting family,&rdquo; said
Miss Madison, when she and her brother finally rose to take
leave. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold Sophy for coming down, will you?
I take it as a great compliment that she wanted to see us. We
have yet to meet your brother and the sister who <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>disappeared
so suddenly the other day. Please be very neighborly, for I like
you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and, Miss Katherine, perhaps you
will come up Monday afternoon and bring some of your music. I
long to play with you. I should be glad to have your sisters
come, too. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must they think of us?&rdquo; exclaimed Honor,
when the front door was finally shut. &ldquo;The whole affair was
too dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so at all,&rdquo; said Katherine.
&ldquo;It was all very funny from beginning to end, and they are
just the kind of people to take it nicely. But did you ever see
such a sight as Sophy! Fancy her taking all my precious
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy her coming down and listening in that way,&rdquo;
said Honor. &ldquo;It was perfectly dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold her about it,&rdquo; said Victoria,
who had joined them. &ldquo;She has been crying so hard, and she
is waiting for you to come to bid her good night, Honor. She
didn&rsquo;t know it wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to do, but
I&rsquo;ve been explaining to her. She was crazy to see the
Madisons, and she forgot she had those things on. I was rather
curious myself to know what you were talking about when I heard
such a jolly time going on down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come down?&rdquo; asked
Katherine. &ldquo;They both asked for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too busy,&rdquo; replied her sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
finished moving you. If I hadn&rsquo;t stayed upstairs, we should
have had to be up all night, or you never would have been ready
for Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon Peter announced his intention of going off
to the woods. He was interested in a pair of birds that had made
their nest in a certain tree, and whenever he had a spare moment
he went to the woods to watch them. He had declined to take Sophy
with him to-day, giving as his reason that she talked too
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see a thing in the woods,&rdquo; he
said wisely, &ldquo;if a girl&rsquo;s along. They always chatter,
chatter, chatter, like a squirrel. When Carney and I go together,
we don&rsquo;t say a word, and pretty soon all the creatures come
out and attend to their business just as they would if we
weren&rsquo;t there. Creatures are awfully afraid of people. You
know you never see anything about when you just go walking
through the woods. They all stay in their holes and nests. But if
you just go sit there and watch and don&rsquo;t make a sound,
they begin to come out, and it&rsquo;s lots of fun. I&rsquo;ll
take Sirius because he minds <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>me and keeps quiet when I tell him
to, but it&rsquo;s no good to say that to Sophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Peter,&rdquo; said Sophy, in an injured tone,
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say a word if you don&rsquo;t want me to.
You tell me things when we are out walking, and then I have to
answer, but I won&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;ll only let me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think you ought to stay at home this
afternoon, Sophy,&rdquo; interposed Honor. &ldquo;You know Aunt
Sophia is coming, and she will be disappointed if her namesake
isn&rsquo;t here to receive her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t been named after her,&rdquo;
remarked Sophy, with an aggrieved air. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful
bother. When you&rsquo;re named for people you always have to do
things you don&rsquo;t want to. Now there&rsquo;s Peter can go to
the woods this afternoon. He couldn&rsquo;t if he was named for
Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a big goose you are!&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;As
if a boy could have been named Sophia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would do a little weeding before you go,
Peter,&rdquo; said Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you could only help me move some of the
furniture in my new room,&rdquo; added Katherine. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t get it fixed to suit me at all, and it is so heavy.
Can&rsquo;t you, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&ldquo;Oh, goodness,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;what a
bother! I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to move the furniture, but the
weeding will have to wait. I tell you, I must go to the woods
this afternoon. Hurry up, now, if you want me upstairs.&rdquo;
And he ran off himself two steps at a time.</p>
<p>Katherine was hard to please, and half an hour at least was
consumed before the furniture was arranged to her satisfaction.
Peter in consequence became more and more ill-tempered, and when
she paused in the midst of her directions to tell him that his
hands were not particularly clean and that his collar was frayed
at the edge, he lost all patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares whether my hands are clean or not for moving
your old furniture,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and if the collar is
frayed at the edge, what made you put it in my drawer when it
came out of the wash? It&rsquo;s your own fault, and speaking of
washing hands, I wash mine of this old sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he departed, leaving the sofa in the middle of the room
for Katherine to move alone as best she could.</p>
<p>Peter and Sirius took their way across the woody pasture
beyond the barn and the garden. <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>It was indeed good to be out of
doors on such a day as this, and there was no knowing what of
interest might be in store for them. Katherine&rsquo;s criticisms
were soon forgotten, and master and dog were happy in each
other&rsquo;s company and in the indefinable something which
pervaded the atmosphere this afternoon of the first of May and
which filled the hearts of both with a sense of elation.</p>
<p>It was an ideal May day, warm and balmy. The songs of the
lately arrived birds filled the air; active little chipmunks,
awakened from their winter&rsquo;s sleep, darted here and there
with amazing fleetness, while the frogs croaked loudly on the
river bank, rejoicing that spring had come.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sirius darted forward in swift pursuit of a little
creature which had ventured forth from its home shortly before
and had been unmindful of the approach of two such hereditary
enemies as a boy and a dog. Quickly though Sirius ran, however,
the little animal, having the start, and becoming conscious at
once that it was being pursued, darted away and was lost to
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a weasel, I verily believe,&rdquo; exclaimed
Peter aloud, running in great excitement to the <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>spot where
it had disappeared. &ldquo;Sirius, why didn&rsquo;t you catch
him? It is the one that has been killing our chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sirius was beside himself with rage and disappointment. There
was enough of the terrier in his nature to make him feel that a
weasel was his lawful prey, and he jumped madly about the stump
where the weasel had disappeared, barking, digging in the ground,
and nosing in every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do believe it lives here, Sirius,&rdquo; said
Peter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him yet. Here&rsquo;s a little
passage-way among the roots of the stump. We&rsquo;ll dig out the
nest as soon as we get a chance, Sirius. I saw a weasel&rsquo;s
nest once, dug it out, and it was as cosy as possible, lined with
dead leaves and grass and feathers and a snake&rsquo;s skin. We
don&rsquo;t want any more dead chickens lying with holes in their
necks, indeed we don&rsquo;t. Come on now, sir! We&rsquo;re going
to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued their walk, Sirius leaving the stump sorely
against his will, and going back to it again and again; and
finally they reached the thicker woods where Sophy had lost her
way on the memorable occasion when the owl had shrieked and had
so sorely frightened her.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;I wish I could find that owl to-day, but I
don&rsquo;t believe he lives in these woods,&rdquo; thought
Peter. &ldquo;I will look for him before I go watch those other
birds. I believe that was the big tree where the owl was sitting
when it yelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked quietly to the spot, and seating himself on a fallen
tree he ordered Sirius to be quiet. Nothing living was to be
seen. The new leaves upon the trees were not very thick as yet,
and the afternoon sun shone warmly through them, resting in
patches on the undergrowth. With his hand on the dog&rsquo;s
collar Peter sat and waited.</p>
<p>Presently a gray squirrel moved cautiously along a branch,
sitting quite still for a moment to watch them with mingled
curiosity and anxiety, and then, finding these strangers so
motionless and apparently so harmless, approaching quite near to
them. It was hard for Sirius to remain quiet with so entrancing
an object of pursuit within easy reach, but he had been well
trained and, above all, he loved Peter, and was not Peter&rsquo;s
hand upon his collar?</p>
<p>Very soon the gray squirrel became tired of looking at them
and ran away, and in the <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>meantime Peter had discovered
something in the tall tree which he had been watching. About
forty feet above him was a hole as large as his own head, and
standing on the edge of this hole was an owl. At first Peter had
not been able to distinguish it, for it was of a mottled brown,
and so like the bark of the tree in color that the difference
could at first glance be scarcely detected. He was quite sure,
however, that it had not been there when he arrived upon the
spot. Neither did he think that it was the same owl that had
given the strange cry the other day. This seemed like a little
screech owl. He made some slight noise, breaking some twigs from
the log on which he was sitting, and in a flash the owl
disappeared within the hole and was seen no more that
afternoon.</p>
<p>Peter sat here until he was tired, watching a snake which
twisted its way through the dead leaves, the gray squirrels which
ran about now in confidence, fancying themselves perfectly
secure, and some birds that had nested in a tree not far away. He
hoped that the snake would not reach the birds&rsquo; nest and
steal the eggs, but it was early in the season yet, and snakes
were <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>still sluggish in their movements. He knew that the
owls were secure, for their eggs had been hatched some time
since, and the young ones were probably well grown. Indeed, there
was a possibility that the other birds, if they escaped the
snake, might fall a prey to the owls that lived in such close
proximity, and that would be only too ready to pounce upon and
devour them at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>At last Peter rose from the log, and releasing Sirius with a
commendatory pat for his good behavior, he walked off through the
woods. There was a sudden rustle in boughs and underbrush,
frightened bird notes sounded from the branches, shrill squirrel
warnings came from the trunks of trees. All the creatures, which
had supposed themselves safe, were terrified by these unexpected
movements on the part of the two hitherto motionless objects that
had been there so long, and quickly gave notice to their
companions that danger was abroad in the forest.</p>
<p>But Peter and Sirius left them unmolested, and continued their
way to the outskirts of the wood. It was later than Peter had
supposed, but he determined to take a still longer walk and to <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>go home by
a round-about way which could be shortened at the end by coming
up the branch railroad which led directly through their
place.</p>
<p>He was walking quickly over this railroad, and was crossing a
bridge which was above the river, when his foot caught on one of
the ties, and he slipped between them. Something seemed to snap
in his leg, and then a blackness came over him. Strange surging
noises sounded in his ears, and he knew no more.</p>
<h2><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="GutSmall">PETER MEETS WITH A SERIOUS
ACCIDENT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the same afternoon upon which
Mrs. Wentworth Ward was to arrive at Glen Arden, and which Peter
spent in the woods, Roger Madison came home on an early train
from Boston and invited his sister to go out on the river with
him. Although Margaret was fully ten years older than himself,
and therefore had been grown up when he was still a small boy,
she had always been his dearest companion. They rode and drove
and fished together, they played and sang, they read the same
books and loved the same pictures, and the pleasure which came to
one was deprived of half its value if it were not shared by the
other.</p>
<p>On this May day therefore they were both more than content
with their lot when, Margaret being comfortably placed in the
canoe, Roger stepped in and pushed away from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up or down shall it be, Margaret?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;Either. Anything is charming, even if we were to
stay exactly where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are so agreeable to anything, I think we will go
up river. There are not apt to be so many people about there as
there are in the neighborhood of Waterview and below. The river
is wilder, too. What a beautiful winding stream the Charles
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paddled quietly up stream, and they talked or not as they
felt inclined, and drank in the sweet-scented air, and watched
the turtles sunning themselves on the rocks, and listened to the
hoarse croaking of the bullfrogs. Finally, as the sun sank in the
west, they turned and floated down with the current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Starrs are very interesting girls, I
think,&rdquo; remarked Roger after a silence that had lasted for
some moments. &ldquo;Miss Katherine is very handsome, but the
elder one&rsquo;s face is very lovely. She is not as strictly
beautiful perhaps, but her expression is such a noble
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine is more interesting to me,&rdquo; said his
sister; &ldquo;I like Honor immensely, but she is more
conventional than Katherine and more self-controlled. Katherine
is full of fire and enthusiasm, <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>and I like it. Plenty of faults, no
doubt, but whole souled. Honor is charming, though,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem very jolly and have plenty of fun in them.
How amusing it was last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very; I like both the girls very much, and I am curious
to meet the other one, Victoria, or Vic, as they call her. Though
she is so young, she seems to be a moving spirit in the family. I
wonder why we haven&rsquo;t met her anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently because she runs away from us. I was sure
last evening that I caught a glimpse of some one peeping through
the door at the back of the hall when that amiable maid of theirs
was telling us that they had gone to bed,&rdquo; said Roger,
laughing at the recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be trying for them to give up so much and work
so hard when they have been accustomed to such a different
life,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;Did you notice the
pictures?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They were chosen by some one with very good
judgment. There were one or two water-colors on the wall that
were excellent, and some fine etchings. I saw two by the same man
who did the one that I gave you at Christmas,
Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you bought of the girl in the picture <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>store? I
feel a special interest in that picture, Roger. I am forever
imagining what kind of a girl she must have been and how she came
to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she had to, I suppose. She was a nice-looking
little thing, and she was a lady. Not exactly pretty, but her
face was interesting. I saw a photograph at the Starrs&rsquo;
last night that reminded me of her. I meant to have told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a feeling that we shall see her again some day,
because I am so deeply interested in her,&rdquo; said Miss
Madison, musingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could feel so
about a person whom I am never to see. But what a keen-sighted
person you are, Roger! Without appearing to look about, you seem
to have absorbed every picture in that room. I daresay you could
tell me the titles of all the books in the cases and the music in
the music racks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well as the number of roses in that child&rsquo;s
wreath,&rdquo; said Roger, laughing; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
missed that sight for the world. What&rsquo;s the matter with
that dog?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>They were about to pass under a railroad bridge not far from
their own home. Standing on the bridge, very near the edge and
almost <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>falling over in his efforts to make himself heard, was
an ungainly-looking yellow dog. He was barking madly,
occasionally varying the sound by piteous whines and yelps of
entreaty. Roger paused and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old fellow?&rdquo; he said
kindly. &ldquo;You had better get off the track. You will be run
over, for it is almost time for a train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hearing his friendly voice, the dog darted from the
bridge and came running and tumbling down the steep bank to the
river&rsquo;s edge, where he renewed his barks and yelping,
turning to run up the bank a little way and then looking back to
see if Roger were coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be the matter, Roger,&rdquo; said Miss
Madison; &ldquo;do go and see! A dog wouldn&rsquo;t behave that
way unless there was some trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger pushed up to shore, and then handing the paddle to his
sister he jumped out and scrambled up the bank, the dog pausing
for a moment to leap about with delight and then running before,
stopping at intervals, however, to make sure that his new friend
was close behind.</p>
<p>The bank was high and steep, but when the <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>top was at
last reached, Roger Madison saw immediately the cause of the
dog&rsquo;s excitement. Upon the bridge, and lying between the
rails with his face down, was the figure of a boy. The dog ran to
him and licked his hands and ears, which were the only parts of
him that were visible. Then he turned to Roger, whining piteously
again, and at that moment was heard the whistle of a train that
was leaving Waterview for its trip over the branch road. In less
than two minutes it would reach the bridge.</p>
<p>Madison attempted to raise the boy, only to find that his foot
was caught between the rail and one of the sleepers in some
curious way. He must move him cautiously or he would do him
injury. Far below was the river, and the boy was lying half-way
across the bridge. There was but a single track here; it would be
necessary to carry him to one end or the other, and the train was
coming. There was no chance that the engineer would see him in
time to stop, for it was growing dark rapidly, and there was a
curve in the road shortly before this part of it was reached.
Should he never be able to extricate the boy&rsquo;s foot?</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>At
last it was free. Standing on the narrow bridge through the
openings of which the river beneath seemed so far away, and with
the puff of the engine drawing nearer and nearer, Roger raised
the lad in his arms and then ran with him to the farther bank. As
he stepped from one end of the bridge the train reached the
other, and in a second more it passed him as he stood by the
track, his burden in his arms.</p>
<p>But what was the heart-rending cry which sounded in his ears
as the train rolled by? What had happened? Roger Madison, strong
man though he was, felt almost faint at the thought. Had the dog
saved his master&rsquo;s life only to lose his own? It could not
be.</p>
<p>But it was so. Sirius had not stirred from Peter&rsquo;s side
until he saw him in a place of security; what happened afterwards
no one ever knew. Probably in his ecstasy at the boy&rsquo;s
safety he had forgotten his own danger and jumped back upon the
track; but whatever the cause, the train passed over him. He lost
his life in saving the beloved master who had once rescued him
from a cruel death. And who, whether dog or man, can ask for a
more glorious end than this?</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>In
the meantime Miss Madison, surmising that something serious was
the matter, had left the canoe drawn up upon the bank, and had
herself climbed up to the top. She reached it soon after the
train had passed and found her brother bending over the still
form of the boy, who lay by the side of the railroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose it is, Margaret?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;We had better take him to the Starrs&rsquo;. It is the
nearest house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Peter Starr, Roger!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Madison. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder at all if it were, and
he looks something like them, as well as I can see in this light.
He has a dog, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has one no longer, then,&rdquo; said Roger, briefly.
&ldquo;The dog is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger, how terrible! What will the poor boy say? But I
had better run before and prepare them. Roger, are you sure the
boy is alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as she spoke, the lad stirred slightly and opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirius,&rdquo; he murmured faintly; &ldquo;come here,
sir!&rdquo; Then he lost consciousness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Peter Starr,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;The
dog&rsquo;s <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>name was Sirius. Follow slowly, Roger. You must give me
time to prepare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran through the woods which bordered on the river bank,
and then emerging upon the open lawn, she hastened towards the
house. Apparently the family were at supper, for no one was to be
seen. Miss Madison opened the front door without ceremony, and
greatly to the astonishment of the Starrs&mdash;including Mrs.
Ward&mdash;appeared at the door of the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your brother at home?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
Though she tried to speak calmly, it was easy to see that
something was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Honor, &ldquo;we were just
wondering&mdash;Miss Madison, what is it?&rdquo; She pushed back
her chair and rose to her feet, as did also Katherine and
Victoria. A certainty that something serious had taken place
filled the hearts of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said they together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so frightened,&rdquo; said Miss
Madison. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t dead; he is only hurt a little,
and Roger is bringing him. We found him. See; they are coming
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked across the lawn, and saw Roger Madison moving
towards the house with a burden <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>in his arms. Could it be Peter?
Madison, who was tall and very strong, carried him as easily as
he would have carried a child of five, although Peter was tall
for his age and was no light weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one get a bed ready for him,&rdquo; said Margaret,
&ldquo;and send at once for a doctor. In the meantime I will help
you. I know a little about surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor and Katherine had run to meet their brother, but
Victoria was ready to do what she was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sophia, please send Dave Carney for the
doctor,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is in the kitchen, I think. I
will go upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will go with you,&rdquo; said Miss Madison.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was much later in the evening, and Peter was now quite
comfortable. The doctor had gone after having set the broken leg
and having assured the Starrs that, although the injury was
serious, there was nothing about it which need alarm them. The
Madisons went home after the doctor came, but Roger intended to
return to inquire for the patient. As yet, nothing had been said
about the fate of Sirius. Peter had been asking for him ever
since <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>he
regained consciousness, and his sisters, supposing the dog to be
at the barn, had promised to give him his supper. The doctor had
left orders that Peter should be kept very quiet, and that Sirius
should not be admitted to his room.</p>
<p>Honor was with her brother now, and Katherine and Victoria
were in their aunt&rsquo;s room. She had arrived by the
designated train that afternoon, accompanied by her maid, her
canaries, and several trunks. The bustle which her coming had
caused had scarcely subsided before supper was announced, and
then had ensued the excitement about Peter. Now, at half-past
eight, she had requested the attendance of Katherine and Victoria
in her room while she unpacked and settled herself for the
summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk over your affairs,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Now that I am really here I wish to be right in your
midst. What have you been living on? How much have you made in
that ridiculous school and those senseless violets? Why people
should spend their money on violets I can&rsquo;t imagine. They
only fade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we had better wait until
to-morrow?&rdquo; suggested Victoria, mildly, as she watched <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>her
aunt&rsquo;s energetic movements about the room. Mrs. Ward had
made it clear to them in the beginning that she wished no
assistance in her unpacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you could talk to Honor about it,&rdquo; continued
Victoria, &ldquo;and to-night we are so worried about
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for worry,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wentworth Ward,
briskly. &ldquo;The boy is in no danger, the doctor said. How he
ever got into such a predicament I can&rsquo;t imagine. If your
friends the Madisons hadn&rsquo;t happened along just when they
did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sophia, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Victoria.
&ldquo;It is too horrible to put into words. How can we ever
thank the Madisons enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how they happened to find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; said Victoria, while
Katherine added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Madison said he would come back later and tell us
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said her aunt, looking at her shrewdly
while she shook out and refolded her garments. &ldquo;Who are
these Madisons?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>&ldquo;Very nice people,&rdquo; replied Katherine, with
exaggerated indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you seem to find them, and they apparently take an
active part in your household affairs. I was amused at Miss
Madison! Running upstairs without ever saying &lsquo;by your
leave&rsquo;! But if they are related to the Roger Madisons, they
are all that one would wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brother&rsquo;s name is Roger,&rdquo; said
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Wentworth Ward, &ldquo;then I
have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After saving Peter&rsquo;s life I think they are at
liberty to do anything they like,&rdquo; said Katherine, with the
asperity which intercourse with her aunt never failed to bring to
the surface. &ldquo;And if they were not the Roger Madisons, what
would you have to say, Aunt Sophia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria, dreading an argument, abruptly turned the
conversation by introducing the matter of the typewriter. It was,
perhaps, a case of leaping from the frying-pan into the fire, but
she felt that anything would be preferable to a lengthy
discussion of the Madisons between her aunt and Katherine, who
never, under any circumstances, were known to agree, and who each
<a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>possessed to the last degree the power of irritating
the other.</p>
<p>Sophy, meanwhile, had been shut out completely both from
Peter&rsquo;s room and from that of her aunt. She had been told
by her sisters to go to bed, but as they had failed to enforce
the command, she had not yet obeyed it. Instead, she wandered
disconsolately over the house, even seeking Blanch in the
kitchen, although she was not a favorite with the child. Sophy
was discriminating, and her prejudices were strong.</p>
<p>She found Blanch engaged in a spirited discussion with the
lately arrived maid from Beacon Street, and her presence was so
completely ignored by them both, that she left the kitchen and
returned to the main part of the house.</p>
<p>Glancing from the window at the side of the front door, she
saw Mr. Madison approaching, and she opened the door and gladly
welcomed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come and talk to me?&rdquo; she said in
a forlorn little voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all alone. I can&rsquo;t
go to Peter&rsquo;s room, and I can&rsquo;t find Sirius, and Aunt
Sophia doesn&rsquo;t want me. Don&rsquo;t you think if somebody
was named for you, you&rsquo;d like to have &rsquo;em in your
room when you were unpacking?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;Indeed I should!&rdquo; said Madison, seating
himself in the parlor, while Sophy took another chair and
prepared to entertain him, after the manner, as she thought, of
her elder sisters when they had visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Sophia is unpacking,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and unpacking is such a very interesting thing to watch. I
think she is asking questions, too. Aunt Sophia asks a great many
questions. When I do, the girls say I&rsquo;m curious, but they
can&rsquo;t say that to Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, scarcely!&rdquo; said Mr. Madison, who was greatly
amused with his small hostess, but preserved a perfectly straight
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks we ought to live with her, but we
don&rsquo;t want to. We would rather work for our living, and so
we teach school and give music lessons and sell mushrooms and
violets, and once Vic went to Boston and sold some gold things
and some&mdash;oh, but I forgot! The girls told me not to tell
anybody that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Roger, gravely; &ldquo;you had better
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps when we get to know you very well, we&rsquo;ll
tell you all about what the man said to Vic, the young
man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;Do you think I can see one of your
sisters?&rdquo; asked he, interrupting her. &ldquo;I want to
speak about Peter, and&mdash;well, to explain to them how I
happened to find him. Will you call one of them? Tell them not to
come if it isn&rsquo;t convenient, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy, going upon this errand, met Victoria on the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to look for Sirius, Sophy,&rdquo; said she,
quite unconscious that some one was in the parlor. &ldquo;It is
strange that he isn&rsquo;t about anywhere. Have you seen
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, a man&rsquo;s figure appeared in the doorway of
the parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you about the dog,&rdquo; said Madison.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise the girl on the stairs turned and ran up
again, leaving him with his sentence unfinished and without
giving him a word of apology. It was most extraordinary behavior,
Roger thought. Unquestionably, charming as the Starr sisters
were, there was one among them who was peculiar. It was not the
first time that Victoria had acted in the unaccountable fashion.
Indeed, that very night, when he had carried Peter to his room,
she had disappeared through one door as he came in the other. <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>He should
think that after having saved her brother&rsquo;s life, she might
treat him at least politely. However, she was only a little girl
of fifteen, he said to himself, and probably knew no better how
to behave. It was strange, though, for the others were
undoubtedly well bred, and even little Sophy had good
manners.</p>
<p>He was about to leave the house, too proud and too indignant
to ask again to see any one, when Katherine came down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy told me that you were here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I am so glad, for we want to thank you for all you
have done. Vic is so upset with Peter&rsquo;s accident that she
couldn&rsquo;t come down, but Honor will be here in a moment.
Indeed, we cannot thank you enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Honor came, and with tears in her eyes expressed her
gratitude for what he had done for them. Madison described to
them how and where he had found Peter, Sophy standing by his
chair and drinking in every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Sirius really saved Peter&rsquo;s life,&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was really the one; for if he hadn&rsquo;t
attracted my attention, I should never have known that he was
there. Sirius was a brave, good dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;Dear Sirius!&rdquo; said Honor. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t like him when he first came here, but now I feel as
if I couldn&rsquo;t do enough for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall buy him a gold collar studded with diamonds the
next time I go to Boston,&rdquo; said Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kathie! Will you really?&rdquo; asked Sophy. &ldquo;And
what will you buy for Mr. Madison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t care for a gold collar,&rdquo;
laughed Katherine. &ldquo;We shall have to do something else for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot thank you enough,&rdquo; said Honor again,
very gravely. It scarcely seemed right to laugh when Peter had
been so near death, and she felt that this debt of gratitude to
Mr. Madison could never be repaid. There was a moment&rsquo;s
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose Sirius is?&rdquo; said Sophy.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen him yet. I want to hug him for
saving my only brother Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, you will never see Sirius again,&rdquo; said
Roger. &ldquo;He lost his own life when he saved Peter&rsquo;s.
He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy gazed at him for a moment in speechless astonishment.
Then she buried her face in his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirius is dead!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Oh, what will
Peter say?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOPHY WAYLAYS ROGER MADISON.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> days elapsed before they
dared tell Peter of the fate of Sirius. The doctor&rsquo;s orders
that he should be kept very quiet must be obeyed, and that was
the excuse which they gave him when the boy begged that Sirius
might come to him.</p>
<p>The spring days, so beautiful in themselves, seemed to have
brought much care and anxiety to the Starrs. Honor was visibly
depressed, but Katherine had her music with Miss Madison to
divert her, and Victoria&rsquo;s feelings, whatever they may have
been, she was careful to hide. The presence of Mrs. Wentworth
Ward made a great change in the household, and Peter&rsquo;s
accident a still more serious one.</p>
<p>There were many extra steps to be taken, and sometimes he was
a difficult patient. He did not mean to be exacting, but he felt
it to be a greater <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>trial than he deserved, to be kept in bed with a broken
leg when the days out of doors were so beautiful, when trees and
grass were daily growing greener, and the creatures had awakened
from their winter&rsquo;s nap, when &ldquo;the time of the
singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in
our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter did not express his feelings in just these words
perhaps, but the thought of all that was beautiful out of doors
made him restless and his pain hard to bear.</p>
<p>Honor and Katherine divided the teaching hours, one remaining
with Peter while the other superintended the school. The spring
weather seemed to affect the pupils also, for at times they
became quite unmanageable. Sometimes Honor wondered if her own
impatience did not react upon herself, influencing the children
and making them more or less refractory. Whatever the cause, the
school had certainly never been so irksome. She was anxious, too,
about Mr. Abbott. He was still very much of an invalid, and they
had not seen him for several months.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, Peter&rsquo;s illness would be a
great expense to them, and Honor wondered <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>how they
should meet the doctor&rsquo;s bills. She felt almost glad that
her aunt was at Glen Arden; for, in spite of the many
inconveniences which her presence brought, it also meant an
increased income, and in the present state of their finances this
was most important. To be sure, Blanch, indignant with the
newcomer in the kitchen, had threatened more than once to leave,
but that was one of the smaller vexations which, perhaps, could
be avoided.</p>
<p>The thought that was now filling the hearts of Peter&rsquo;s
sisters with dread, was the fact that the time was rapidly
approaching when they must tell him that Sirius was dead. Each
one wondered how and when it was to be done and who should be the
one to do it. They finally decided upon Victoria.</p>
<p>And so with an anxious heart, one afternoon Victoria went to
her brother&rsquo;s room. She knew that she should have no
difficulty in introducing the subject, for Peter&rsquo;s first
question was always in regard to Sirius, and the sisters had
found it almost impossible to answer him without arousing his
suspicions. As she supposed would be the case, Victoria had
scarcely crossed the <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>threshold when she heard her
brother&rsquo;s somewhat querulous voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic, where is Sirius? It does seem very hard that I
can&rsquo;t see my own dog. He wouldn&rsquo;t excite me, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t jump on the bed if I told him not to. It excites
me a great deal more not to see him, than it would if he were
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Peter dear!&rdquo; said Victoria, going to the
bed and sitting down upon the edge of it. &ldquo;And there is
nothing we would rather do, than bring Sirius to you. But we
can&rsquo;t. Will you try to bear it, Peter, when I tell you
something very sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Vic?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, in a low
voice. &ldquo;I know what you are going to say! Is Sirius
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria nodded. Peter turned his face towards the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go away,&rdquo; he said, still in the same low
voice, and Victoria left him.</p>
<p>She returned in a short time to find him still in the same
position. When she spoke to him he did not reply, and though she
went again and again, it was always with the same result.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&ldquo;What are we to do with him?&rdquo; she said
later to her sisters. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t speak, and he just
lies there with his face turned away. If he would only cry about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter won&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said Sophy. &ldquo;He
thinks it&rsquo;s babyish. He was awful fond of Sirius, though.
I&rsquo;ve seen him kiss him often, on the top of his head, and
he never likes to kiss anybody else. Oh dear, I wish I could do
something to make him feel better!&rdquo; The loving little
sister&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears, and she hid her face in
Honor&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;he thinks
we&rsquo;re only girls and so he won&rsquo;t talk to us. If
father were here, or Mr. Abbott, it would be better. I really
believe Peter would speak to them. If we only had
somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was unusual for Victoria&rsquo;s courage to desert her, but
it had all been very sad and depressing. Peter&rsquo;s accident
had unnerved her, and the subsequent dread of breaking the news
to him, and then the disclosure itself, had been more of a strain
than she realized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had an older brother!&rdquo; she said, and
then greatly to the surprise of the others she too began to cry.
&ldquo;What a goose I am!&rdquo; she sobbed. <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>&ldquo;But
I do feel so sorry for Peter and for all of us, and I wish he
would speak to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Mr. Madison would come and talk to
him,&rdquo; suggested Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ask him to,&rdquo; said Honor, quickly.
&ldquo;We must never ask him to do a thing. He would be the very
one, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, for Peter likes him, and he was the one
who saved his life and was there when Sirius was killed, but it
would never do to ask him. If he were to come of his own accord,
it would be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a great pity, then, that he can&rsquo;t know
how much he is needed,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;He seems to
be the kind of man who always knows exactly what to say, and he
is so good-natured he wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming a bit. Do you
really think, Honor, that it wouldn&rsquo;t do to ask
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor shook her head very decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Sophy, who had been listening attentively, dried her eyes. She
was extremely disturbed by Victoria&rsquo;s emotion, as were they
all. It was so unusual to see her cry that Sophy felt that
something very serious must be the matter. The little girl was
ready to do anything to make her happier or to help Peter. <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>The girls
all said that to talk to a grown-up man would be the best thing
for Peter, and that Mr. Madison would be the one of all others.
Why not get Mr. Madison, then? To be sure, Honor had said that he
must not be asked, but perhaps he would come without being asked
if he knew that Peter needed him. Sophy felt very confident that
Mr. Madison was a kind-hearted man, and if he were once told that
he was needed, he would not wait to be asked.</p>
<p>She tried to say something of this to her sisters, but they
were talking to each other and endeavoring to comfort Victoria,
and she could not make them hear, so she determined to act for
herself. She heard the whistle of one of the afternoon trains as
it left the junction at Waterview. Perhaps Mr. Madison was on
it!</p>
<p>Without further delay, she ran downstairs and out the front
door. Like a young squirrel she scampered across the lawn and
along the grassy path that led to the little station, arriving
there just as the train did. One passenger only left it, and,
greatly to her disappointment, it was not Mr. Madison.</p>
<p>There would not be another train for a long <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>time, she
knew, but nevertheless Sophy determined to wait for it. She was
afraid that if she went back to the house, something or, more
probably, somebody, would prevent her coming again, and she had
made up her mind that the only way to secure Mr. Madison was to
meet him at the train. She sat down on the edge of the
platform,&mdash;there was no house here, only a little shed at
which the trains stopped,&mdash;and waited.</p>
<p>The sun, which was warm to-day, shone down upon her, the soft
May breezes played with the daisies that had sprung up about the
railroad track, little birds gathered courage from her stillness,
and hopped nearer to the small figure, looking at her with
inquisitive glances, but Sophy heeded nothing. Many serious
thoughts were passing through her childish mind in rapid
succession. She wondered why Sirius had to die when they all
loved him so, and it made it so hard for Peter. She wondered if
there was anything in the world that she could do to make Peter
happier.</p>
<p>And Victoria! She was so surprised to see real tears on
Vic&rsquo;s face. Was Vic a baby to cry, as Peter always said
that Sophy was? She had <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>never seen her do it before except
when their father died. Then everybody had cried. Where was her
father now, she wondered? Did he know they were all so sad and
there was so little money? Where had he gone, and where had they
come from? How strange everything was, and how puzzling! Sophy
supposed that she should understand it all when she grew up.</p>
<p>In the meantime she wished that the train would come. She was
tired of waiting, and perhaps Vic was still crying, and Peter
still lying so strangely silent, with his face turned away from
them, as they went one by one to express their sympathy. Would
the train never come?</p>
<p>And at last it did come, and, to her intense relief, Mr.
Madison was on it. He was the only passenger who left it, and he
was greatly surprised when a small and hatless figure danced up
to him and seized his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you!&rdquo; cried a lisping
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting ever and ever and ever so
long!&rdquo; Sophy&rsquo;s face looked almost pretty in her
excitement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to ask you to come,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;for Honor says you must never be asked to
do anything; but we want a grown-up <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>man so dreadfully to talk to Peter.
Peter won&rsquo;t say anything, and he knows Sirius is dead. He
thinks we&rsquo;re only girls, and if you were only our brother,
you would talk to him. I wish you were our brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even if I am not, I can talk to Peter,&rdquo; said
Roger Madison, quickly, &ldquo;and that is what you would like,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Sophy; &ldquo;and I
haven&rsquo;t asked you, have I? Honor said, you know, that you
must never be asked to do anything. I don&rsquo;t exactly see why
not. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind asking you a bit, but I haven&rsquo;t,
have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no indeed! I&rsquo;m coming entirely of my own free
will. I want to talk to Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said Sophy, as, with her hand
tightly clasped in his, she skipped along at his side. &ldquo;You
are such a nice man. You would make a lovely brother. You see,
everything was dreadful this afternoon, and Vic really
cried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy said this with the air of imparting a most unheard-of
piece of news. That Vic should cry was to her almost as important
as Peter&rsquo;s broken leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right upstairs,&rdquo; said she, when they <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>reached the
house. &ldquo;Come right up to Peter&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better say that I am here,&rdquo; said
Madison, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo; exclaimed Sophy, impatiently; but
seeing that he was firm in regard to this, she ran upstairs and
peeped into Peter&rsquo;s room. He was still lying with his face
turned away, and she did not look far enough to see that Victoria
was sitting behind the door. She ran down again as quickly as she
had gone up and once more grasped Mr. Madison by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come right
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They mounted the stairs, and still hand in hand they entered
Peter&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said the small sister,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a grown-up man come to see you. Here is Mr.
Madison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter turned his head, and Sophy gave a sigh of relief. He had
actually moved and was looking at them. At the same moment an
exclamation of surprise came from some one else. Victoria rose to
her feet and stood for a moment in silence. She gave one glance
at Mr. Madison, and then her eyes fell, while the color came and
went in her <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>cheeks. She looked precisely as she had looked in the
picture shop and stood in almost the same attitude. Madison
recognized her at once, and he held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to meet you again,&rdquo; he said
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell any one,&rdquo; said Victoria.
&ldquo;No one knows it, and I&rsquo;ve tried not to meet you.
Honor wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he, gravely, and Victoria could
see that he was surprised at her remark. &ldquo;Just as you say,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she left the room, wondering if she had said the wrong
thing. Was it what Honor would call &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo;?
She wished that she had never tried to hide the fact that she had
met Roger Madison before. It was such a little thing in itself,
and yet it was constantly leading her to do rude and peculiar
things. This was certainly a most trying afternoon, and again
Victoria shut herself into her room and cried, and though Sophy
came more than once and rattled the handle of the door, she would
not let her in.</p>
<p>Sophy, when Mr. Madison was safely shut into Peter&rsquo;s
room, lost no time in making known the fact to her sisters.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&ldquo;Why, Sophy!&rdquo; exclaimed Honor. &ldquo;How
did he happen to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him at the station,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I
told him we wished we had a grown-up man, and so he said he would
come. I didn&rsquo;t ask him to, Honor. Really and truly I
didn&rsquo;t ask him to come. I only said we needed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sophy dear, that amounted to the same thing, and
don&rsquo;t you remember that I said we mustn&rsquo;t ask him. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have had you do it for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why, Honor. You asked Miss Madison to
come the other day. Why can&rsquo;t we ask Mr.
Madison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cases are very different,&rdquo; said Honor,
somewhat severely, &ldquo;and you ought not to have done what I
told you not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear me,&rdquo; cried Sophy, tears again trembling
on her lashes, &ldquo;I only wanted to make Peter better, and I
didn&rsquo;t really ask him to come! I only said I wished he was
our brother, for then he&rsquo;d be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say that, surely, Sophy!&rdquo;
exclaimed Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; said Sophy, surprise at <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Katherine&rsquo;s vehemence drying her tears.
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; interposed Honor. &ldquo;It is too
late now, but another time, Sophy, please be more careful to do
exactly as I say. Isn&rsquo;t it time for you to go to your music
lesson, Katherine? I am going to Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s room to see
if she wants anything. Come, Sophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sophy declined to accompany her. She sat on the top step
of the stairs, waiting for Vic to emerge from her locked room or
for Mr. Madison to leave Peter. She thought her sisters were all
very peculiar to-day. She had heard Victoria&rsquo;s remark to
Mr. Madison and she wondered what she could have meant. She
stored it away in the recesses of her memory, intending to ask
about it when a convenient opportunity should present itself.</p>
<p>When Roger Madison was left alone with Peter, he quietly
closed the door, and drawing up the chair which Victoria had
vacated he sat down near the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you want to hear all about your brave, good
dog,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and so I have come to tell you. He
saved his master&rsquo;s life if ever a <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>dog did. If
it hadn&rsquo;t been for him, you wouldn&rsquo;t be lying here
now. Would you like me to tell you about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>And then Mr. Madison described to him the scene on the
bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a glorious end for Sirius,&rdquo; said he, when
he had finished. &ldquo;I know you feel badly enough about losing
your dog. So should I. Indeed, I went through very much the same
experience myself once, when I was a little younger than
you&mdash;no, perhaps about your age. You are fourteen,
aren&rsquo;t you? I lost a dog that I was very fond of, and if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for my sister I should have been very selfish
about it. She showed me how I ought to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy for girls to talk,&rdquo; said
Peter. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all been in here this afternoon,
telling me I ought to bear it, and make the best of it, and all
that. As if I could ever get over losing Sirius, the best dog
that ever lived! It is ridiculous for those girls to talk the way
they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Roger Madison, &ldquo;do
you know that you are a very lucky fellow to have those sisters?
I&rsquo;ve often wondered whether you <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>appreciated them. I have one sister,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t give her up for all the money in the world.
You have four, so you ought to be four times as
grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For four sisters?&rdquo; said Peter, incredulously.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nice enough, of course, but they order a
fellow round too much, and they don&rsquo;t understand. They seem
to think I oughtn&rsquo;t to mind about Sirius a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they feel that way. They have been
very much worried about you, and they have felt pretty badly, I
can tell you, about Sirius&rsquo;s death and the way you would
feel it. I happen to know that, and I also know that your sister
Victoria has been crying about it this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic crying?&rdquo; Peter seemed to be as much impressed
by this fact as Sophy had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are about the pluckiest girls that I ever
knew,&rdquo; continued Madison. &ldquo;If they were my sisters, I
should be mighty proud of them, I can tell you. I&rsquo;ve no
doubt that you are too, and are doing all you can to
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I can do,&rdquo; said Peter, gloomily.
&ldquo;Just lying here and looking out at the trees and wishing I
was out there. And I&rsquo;ve been <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>wanting Sirius so much and wishing
he could come to me, and now I&rsquo;ll never see him
again.&rdquo; He turned his face away as he had done before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;I like you and I
think there&rsquo;s good stuff in you. Here&rsquo;s a chance for
you to show it. You can be a hero just as much as Sirius was,
though in a very different way. You have a good deal to bear. A
broken leg is no small matter, and the loss of your dog is a
great sorrow to you, but if you try to be brave about it all, and
try to make things easier for your sisters while you are laid up
instead of worrying them in any way, I think you will be doing a
good deal. I know it&rsquo;s hard. We men are not very patient,
and we don&rsquo;t bear pain and discomfort as well as women do.
Do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, scornfully; &ldquo;that
can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is so. If one of your sisters had broken her
leg and were lying here, she would probably be three times as
patient as either you or I should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor or Vic, perhaps,&rdquo; remarked Peter,
&ldquo;but not Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not able to judge of that, of course,
<a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>but I
wish you would show that our sex occasionally does know how to
behave under trying circumstances. I wish you&rsquo;d do your
best to be a hero. I was ill once, and when I got well, they told
me I had nearly driven them all crazy,&mdash;I was so impatient
and exacting,&mdash;so you see I don&rsquo;t exactly practise
what I preach. But that was a good while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come to see me again,&rdquo; said
Peter, when his new friend rose to take leave. &ldquo;You may say
that girls are so fine, and all that, but I&rsquo;d like to talk
to you once in a while. I want to ask you something. I think
I&rsquo;ll ask you now. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s pretty
mean that I&rsquo;m so much younger than the others, and that the
girls have to work, when if I&rsquo;d been the eldest I could
have taken care of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Roger Madison, &ldquo;depend
upon it, you are placed in the family just where you are most
needed. God knows better than we do about such things, as He does
about everything else, and He intended you to be of use just
where you are. And I think He means you to begin at once to be of
use; and you can be so by being as brave as Sirius was. There are
several kinds <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>of courage and they are equally good. The courage to be
patient and cheerful and kind when you don&rsquo;t feel like it
counts for as much in the eyes of God as the courage which saves
a life. I don&rsquo;t often talk like this, but I&rsquo;m
interested in you, Peter, and I want you to be the man I think
you have it in you to be. Good-bye. I&rsquo;ll come in again
to-morrow, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

261</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VICTORIA MEETS WITH
DIFFICULTIES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me that you are
not as proficient as one would expect. There are a number of
mistakes in this letter. How long have you been using the
typewriter, Victoria?&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup>&ldquo;</sup>Not very long, Aunt Sophia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few&mdash;at least, some weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeks? I supposed that you had owned one for months. In
fact, it has never been explained to me where you got it nor how
you happened to get it. Who bought the typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which one of you? I am under the impression that it
belongs to Katherine. Am I right? Did she buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply. The aunt and niece were in Mrs. Wentworth
Ward&rsquo;s room this afternoon in June, engaged with the
correspondence of the latter. It was a beautiful day, and
Victoria longed <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>to be out of doors. She had watched Katherine go across
the lawn with her music-roll under her arm, and she knew that she
was going to the house on the hill to read music with Miss
Madison. Honor was sitting under the trees with Sophy and Peter,
who was able now to be out of doors, lying stretched out in a
steamer chair. Victoria alone was in the house this golden
afternoon; and, anxious though she was to finish her task and be
off,&mdash;no doubt for that very reason,&mdash;she had never
worked so slowly. Her mistakes were innumerable, and several
times she had been obliged to rewrite a note because of her
aunt&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with its appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of you bought the typewriter?&rdquo; repeated
Mrs. Ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know, Aunt Sophia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my reasons. Who bought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought so! I was sure that Honor told me so. And
why does not Katherine use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has so much else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet she seems to have time to go to the
Madisons&rsquo; almost, if not quite every day. Katherine is
selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sophia, I don&rsquo;t think
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not think so, but that does not alter the
facts. She is both selfish and extravagant&mdash;two serious
faults. It is well for all of you that she is in a fair way to
make a good match, but I am sorry for the young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Sophia, what do you mean?&rdquo; asked
Victoria, gazing at her aunt in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you must see for yourself what I mean. I shall
say no more, but it is a self-evident fact. I will talk to Honor
about it. There is nothing to be said against his family, and he
seems to be a very nice young man,&mdash;good manners,
good-looking, and all that, but Katherine is very
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young! I should think so,&rdquo; said Victoria,
indignantly. &ldquo;Katherine hasn&rsquo;t an idea of anything of
the kind, and I don&rsquo;t see why it should ever have occurred
to you, Aunt Sophia. Can&rsquo;t people, men and women, I mean,
be good friends without <i>that</i> being thought of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very seldom, my dear. But why you should be so
disturbed by my remarks I cannot imagine. Your cheeks are
flushed, and your eyes are like saucers. One would think that I
had suggested something quite unusual and very much to be <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>dreaded,
instead of an event which would be most desirable in every
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be desirable at
all!&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria. &ldquo;Excuse me, Aunt Sophia,
for contradicting you, but I can&rsquo;t help it. It would be
perfectly hateful to have either Honor or Katherine married, and
to Mr. Madison of all people. Oh, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not, Victoria? Why have you such an aversion
for Mr. Madison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because,&rdquo; said Victoria, breaking down
somewhat lamely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to marry any one.
I wish you hadn&rsquo;t told me. Not that I think there is
anything in it at all, but&mdash;but it just makes me think about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most sincerely wish I had not,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs.
Wentworth Ward. &ldquo;It has quite prevented your being of any
further assistance to me this afternoon, and we may as well lay
aside these other papers. You are usually so sensible that I
supposed you would be so in this case. It is quite absurd for you
to become so excited. There is another question that I wish to
speak about to one of you, but I will wait until I see Honor. She
is the proper one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I do, Aunt Sophia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria was sorry that she had allowed her excitement to run
away with her. If it had been any one but Roger Madison whom her
aunt had suggested as a possible husband for Katherine, she could
have borne it better, but try as she would, and much as she
really liked the young man, she could not overcome the feeling
that she had about him in regard to the sale of the etchings.</p>
<p>That affair had assumed astounding proportions in her mind.
From constant brooding over it without imparting the facts of the
case to any one else, she had greatly exaggerated their
importance. It seemed to her out of the question that Katherine
should be allowed to become engaged while in ignorance of it, and
in that event, Honor too should be told, and yet after her long
silence she dreaded speaking of it. She wished that she could ask
the advice of some one else, some older person, but there was no
one. If it were upon any other subject, she would go at once to
Miss Madison, she thought, who was so kind and friendly, but
under the circumstances of course that was out of the
question.</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Even
though Victoria and Roger Madison had met that afternoon in
Peter&rsquo;s room, she had tried since to avoid him. This was
not easy, for he came to the house very frequently, ostensibly to
see Peter. Was it really to see Katherine? She wondered what
other alarming news her Aunt Sophia might have to disclose.
Something disagreeable, she had no doubt, and she would try to
save Honor from hearing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will tell me,&rdquo; she said, as she
watched her aunt fold up the unanswered letters, replace them in
their envelopes, and lay them away in the proper pigeon-hole in
her desk. &ldquo;I will try not to be so excited over this, but
the other was such a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt this will be also,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wentworth Ward, &ldquo;and probably you will take up the cudgels
in defence of the young man just as violently as you have scouted
the idea of Katherine&rsquo;s plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her plans? And what young man? Are you again speaking
of Mr. Madison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by any means. I am speaking of the young man who
attends to so much of your gardening, and who, as far as I can
make out, has <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>more confidence reposed in him, than any one else who
comes to Glen Arden. I mean David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David? Dave Carney? Why, Aunt Sophia, what is the
trouble about him? We have always found him so
satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so, and therefore you have never taken the
trouble to find out anything else about him. Where did you get
him in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter met him in Fordham, and brought him
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to tell me that is all you know about
him? Did you look up his references?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;m
not sure. Honor attends to all such things. But why, Aunt Sophia?
What makes you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to suspect him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wentworth Ward. &ldquo;When I was in Boston yesterday I saw him,
or some one who closely resembled him, going into a
pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, and since then I have questioned Ellen
Higgins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Higgins was Mrs. Ward&rsquo;s maid whom she had brought
with her to Glen Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does she say?&rdquo; asked Victoria. She did
not fancy Ellen herself, and since her <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>advent
there had been endless trouble in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not like him, and she thinks you trust him
entirely too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria felt like replying, &ldquo;I wish Ellen Higgins would
mind her own business,&rdquo; but she restrained herself. Instead
she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all like Dave Carney, and we have found him very
satisfactory, but I think, after all, that Honor is the one for
you to speak to about him. And now if you will excuse me, I will
go&mdash;that is, if you have quite finished with the
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have finished because you were doing it so
badly,&rdquo; said her aunt. &ldquo;I am ashamed to send such
miserable typewriting as you did this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not let me write the letters over with a pen, Aunt
Sophia? I write a very clear hand, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer the typewriter for many reasons, and as you
own one, you should be able to make use of it, even if Katherine
was the one to buy it. I am astonished at you all. You are very
headstrong. Now you may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Victoria quickly took her departure.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>Her
mind was filled with the new ideas presented to her, but she
found time to wonder why her aunt was not willing to have her
notes and various documents written in a good clear hand with a
pen, instead of insisting upon having them typewritten. But such
a question was of minor importance, she thought, as she ran
downstairs and across the lawn. Even if she could not tell Honor
what was troubling her about Katherine, it would be a comfort to
be near her.</p>
<p>She had two secrets now to keep from her sisters, and
strangely enough, they were both connected with Roger Madison.
Victoria felt that life had become very complicated within the
last few months.</p>
<p>She found her eldest sister sitting on a rustic bench under
the trees, with her work in her hands. She was making a dress for
Sophy, who was playing with her doll, but who was so deeply
interested in Peter&rsquo;s occupation that the doll was
frequently neglected.</p>
<p>Peter was lying back in his chair while he held an opera-glass
to his eyes and gazed up into the branches of the tree above him.
No one had spoken for some time, and when Victoria drew near, <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>her brother
held up his hand with a gesture of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Victoria sank quietly upon the grass and waited. It gave her
time to think over her aunt&rsquo;s disturbing speeches, and for
this she was not sorry.</p>
<p>The silence lasted for some minutes, and then Peter put down
his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a robin&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I thought it was, from the shape. I bet if we could see
into it, we&rsquo;d find it was lined with mud. Robins&rsquo;
nests always are. The young ones are getting quite big, and one
is terribly greedy when the old ones come. I daresay it is a
cowbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said they were robins, Peter,&rdquo; said
Sophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did, but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent a cowbird
being there too, does it? That is just what those hateful
cowbirds do. They are too lazy to build nests of their own, but
they go and lay their eggs in other birds&rsquo; nests whenever
they get a chance, and never go near them again. Then the
cowbird&rsquo;s egg gets hatched with the robin&rsquo;s or the
catbird&rsquo;s eggs, or whatever nest it happens to have been
laid in, and the little cowbird is awfully greedy and <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>snatches
all the food, and grows up to be just like its parents. Oh, they
are hateful birds! I was reading about them to-day in a book Mr.
Madison lent me on birds. It said there that no self-respecting
American bird will have anything to do with cowbirds. English
sparrows are the only birds that will go with them. I thought
that was pretty good, for every one knows that an English sparrow
hasn&rsquo;t much self-respect. I&rsquo;m sure that is a cowbird
up there, poking its head so far out and snatching, every time
the old robins come with the worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter, I wish you would let me look!&rdquo; said
Sophy, in pleading tones.</p>
<p>Peter hesitated. He was very much interested in the
proceedings in the tree; the opera-glass was adjusted to exactly
the right point for his eyes, and in all probability Sophy would
move it&mdash;she always did. Then, again, Sophy would never be
able to locate the nest, and much valuable time would be wasted
for nothing.</p>
<p>He was about to refuse her request when a new idea occurred to
him. After all, it was not much to do for Sophy, who had been so
devoted to him ever since his accident. She had run up and down
<a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>stairs
for him forty times a day. In fact, she had gone to the house a
short time ago when he had expressed a wish for the opera-glass,
and had brought it to him, and again for a book on birds. She
never refused to do what he asked; on the contrary, she was eager
to please him.</p>
<p>Peter handed her the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look right up the trunk of the tree, Soph,&rdquo; he
said kindly, &ldquo;till you get to the second branch from the
top to the right, and a little way along that, leaning up against
a small branch that isn&rsquo;t much more than a twig, is the
robin&rsquo;s nest. Do you see? With all those heads sticking
out. They&rsquo;re getting hungry, I guess, for the old birds
haven&rsquo;t been back for ten minutes at least. They hear us
talking, I suppose, and are afraid to come. Keep very quiet, now,
if you&rsquo;ve found the nest, and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy, greatly pleased, peered up into the tree and waited.
She had scarcely dared hope that Peter would allow her to look,
and her heart was filled with an overpowering love for the
brother who was so good to her.</p>
<p>It was a little thing for him to do, perhaps, but Peter felt
happier than if he had declined to point out the nest to Sophy,
and even though it did take <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>her a long time to find it, and
though she turned the screw to and fro in her efforts to see
better, and retained possession of the glass for at least ten
minutes, he was glad on the whole that he had lent it to her.</p>
<p>Victoria sat upon the grass, absent-mindedly poking a hole in
the ground with a bit of stick that she had found, and thinking
about the very disturbing topic that had been suggested to her by
her aunt. She did not pay much attention to the remarks about
Dave Carney, for she considered her aunt a very prejudiced person
who had objected to the boy&rsquo;s presence at Glen Arden from
the first.</p>
<p>The news about Katherine was far more alarming, and while she
thought about it the sound of voices was heard in the distance,
and the very persons of whom she was thinking were seen coming
down the avenue towards the group under the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, impatiently,
&ldquo;here they all come! Now I shall have no chance at the
birds at all. Mr. Madison is an awfully good fellow, but I wish
he had stayed away this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s glance chanced to rest upon Honor at this
moment, and she was surprised to see a peculiar expression cross
her face and the color deepen in <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>her cheeks. She wondered if Aunt
Sophia&rsquo;s absurd ideas about Katherine and Roger Madison
could possibly have occurred to her as well. In that case,
perhaps they were not so absurd. She really thought she must talk
to Honor about it that very night. There could be no harm in
doing so, and she felt that she was incapable of bearing the
burden of two secrets.</p>
<p>In the meantime there was no necessity for staying where she
was if Roger Madison were coming, so Victoria rose at their
approach, and waving her hand to them walked back to the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does your sister, Victoria, always run away from
us?&rdquo; said Miss Madison, as she seated herself beside Honor.
&ldquo;I like her so much, and I wish I could see more of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t run away from <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
Sophy before Honor could reply. Miss Madison as well as her
brother was a great favorite with the child, and she would have
liked to gaze for hours at the beautiful face had her sisters not
admonished her so frequently for staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brother,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why my brother?&rdquo; said Miss Madison in
surprise.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the truthful
Sophy, &ldquo;but ever since you came I&rsquo;ve noticed that Vic
ran away from your brother, and the other day when she was in
Peter&rsquo;s room and didn&rsquo;t know he was coming and I
brought him in, Vic said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any one.
I&rsquo;ve tried not to meet you. Nobody knows it.&rsquo; I asked
her afterwards what she meant, and she wouldn&rsquo;t tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sophy, what are you talking about?&rdquo; asked
Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Madison knows, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the
child, turning to him. &ldquo;Will you tell me what Vic
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, if Miss Victoria won&rsquo;t tell you
herself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I think you must ask her. Did you
see the bird&rsquo;s nest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Sophy, nodding her head wisely,
&ldquo;but you are only trying to get out of telling me by
changing the subject. We weren&rsquo;t talking about
birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will talk about them now, Sophy,&rdquo; said
Honor, quietly, while she wondered what the child could mean.
&ldquo;We have been studying birds all the afternoon, Mr.
Madison, and there are several questions that I know Peter wants
to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>But
Honor determined to speak to Victoria that very night, for she
too had noticed her peculiar conduct, so unlike Vic&rsquo;s usual
open and cordial manner. There must be some reason for it, and
Honor would have questioned her about it before this had there
not been so many other things to occupy their minds.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful evening, and after supper the family sat on
the piazza while the twilight deepened after the long June day,
and in time the light of the moon made itself felt, and shone
down upon the lawn where the trees cast such strange shadows.</p>
<p>Peter lay in the hammock until his bedtime, and after he and
Sophy had gone upstairs and Mrs. Ward into the house to establish
herself with her book by the parlor lamp, with the remark that
she had no time to waste in moon gazing, the three sisters were
left alone.</p>
<p>Victoria, who was anxious to speak with Honor, wished that
there was something which would take Katherine into the house or
elsewhere, that she might have the desired opportunity, for her
words were meant for Honor&rsquo;s ears alone.</p>
<p>Honor, while equally desirous of speaking to <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>Victoria,
was perfectly willing to do so in Katherine&rsquo;s presence. The
three had always been in the habit of talking freely together,
and so Honor opened the subject at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you always try to avoid the Madisons,
Vic?&rdquo; said she, suddenly.</p>
<p>Victoria started guiltily. How strange, she thought, that
Honor should have pounced upon the very topic that was occupying
her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said she. It was a difficult matter for
Victoria to attempt evasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know you do. There must be some reason for it.
We have all noticed it, and Miss Madison spoke of it this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t try to avoid <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we know that,&rdquo; said Katherine, &ldquo;but you
do avoid Roger, and it is very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger! Do you call him Roger?&rdquo; asked Victoria,
somewhat icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not to his face,&rdquo; rejoined
Katherine, impatiently, &ldquo;but I hear his sister speak of him
so often that I did it then without thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;You might do it without thinking before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;You must think I am very stupid,&rdquo; laughed
Katherine, &ldquo;and I am not quite so ignorant of the ways of
the world as all that! Honor, you are too funny about Roger
Mad&mdash;I mean, Mr. Madison, begging all your pardons! He is so
nice and jolly, and sings so well, but you never will go there
much, and Vic is still queerer. Come now, Vicky, and tell us why
you run away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you anything,&rdquo; replied
Victoria, in a somewhat stifled voice. &ldquo;I wish you
wouldn&rsquo;t ask me such unnecessary questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not unnecessary, dear,&rdquo; said Honor,
gently. &ldquo;If you have any reason for doing it, you really
ought to tell us. When it reaches such a pass that even little
Sophy speaks of it, and repeated before us all this afternoon
what you said to Mr. Madison the day you met him in Peter&rsquo;s
room, I really think you ought to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Sophy do that?&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria.
&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you begged Mr. Madison not to tell any one, and
that you had tried not to meet him, and that no one knew it. It
is certainly very mysterious, Vic, and I think you ought to tell
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria, sitting on the steps with her white dress <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>gleaming in
the moonlight, was silent. She would like to tell them the whole
story. Should she do so? But then, if Katherine&mdash;she stopped
short, even in her thoughts. She wished that her Aunt Sophia had
never presented so disagreeable an idea to her imagination.</p>
<p>Should she tell them, or should she not? It would be a
distinct relief to talk it over with them, and to feel free at
last from the burden of a secret. She was about to speak when
Katherine motioned to her to be silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Katherine said in a whisper. She
had been watching intently the clump of trees and shrubbery, near
the side of the house, which separated them from the flower
garden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard something or somebody
moving, and I thought I saw the shadow of a man. Who can it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go find out,&rdquo; said Victoria,
promptly, glad to have the matter decided for her and the subject
changed. &ldquo;It was probably a night-hawk or an owl. It
couldn&rsquo;t be a man, Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three went around the corner of the house and walked about
among the shrubbery. No thought of fear entered their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, after all,&rdquo; said Katherine at
last. <a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;I must have been mistaken, but it was exactly
like the shadow of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am going to bed as long as your shadow
isn&rsquo;t going to materialize,&rdquo; said Victoria; &ldquo;so
good night, girls!&rdquo; And abruptly leaving them, she went
into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is funny about Vic, isn&rsquo;t it, Honor?&rdquo;
said Katherine. &ldquo;I mean that she won&rsquo;t explain why
she doesn&rsquo;t like Mr. Madison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, and I am going to speak to her again about it.
Perhaps she would tell me more if we were alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean without me? Why, I should like to know?
However, if you do find out, you mustn&rsquo;t fail to tell me,
for I really am most curious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Victoria</span> went upstairs to her room,
but it was long before she went to bed. Sophy was fast asleep in
her little bed in the corner, and Victoria knew that there was no
danger of her waking. The shades at the two windows had been
drawn as high as they would go, and the moonlight streamed in,
lying in white patches upon the floor and making the room as
light as day.</p>
<p>Victoria sat down in the shadow near one of the windows and
looked out into the night. Her room was next to that of her aunt,
and over the dining-room. Beneath her window was the shrubbery in
which Katherine had heard the suspicious sounds a short time
since. Beyond lay the flower garden, the beds bathed in the
moonlight, and the roses lifting their heads to catch the dew. On
the other side of the flower garden was the vegetable patch, and
beyond that again the pasture and the woods.</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>The
window near which she sat was directly above the bay-window of
the dining-room, the roof of which projected from the side of the
house. Vines grew up over the dining-room window and had been
trained on either side of Victoria&rsquo;s, so that in summer
time she looked through a veritable bower of green, and this year
a pair of bluebirds had built their nest there and sometimes
wakened her in the early dawn with their sweet singing.</p>
<p>Victoria sat for a long time quite motionless. She heard her
aunt come up to her room and, after a half-hour of activity,
subside into the tranquillity of night. She felt it to be a
merciful arrangement of human affairs and habits that people were
forced to rest for a few hours out of the twenty-four, otherwise
the stirring nature of Mrs. Wentworth Ward would know no
calm.</p>
<p>She heard Katherine mount to her rooms in the third story, and
Honor go to hers on the other side of the house.</p>
<p>At last all was still. Victoria&rsquo;s brain, wide awake and
unusually alert for this hour of the night, was still occupied
with the tiresome topics of the afternoon. She felt that she
could not <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>sleep until she had imparted some of the new ideas with
which it was teeming to some one, and that some one must be
Honor. Her sister could not yet be asleep, Victoria thought; so
leaving her window wide open, she went across the hall and around
the gallery to Honor&rsquo;s room and knocked softly on the door.
Her sister opened it at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Vic?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Are
you ill? Why, you are still in your dress, and you came up two
hours ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. Hush, Honor, don&rsquo;t speak so loud! I
don&rsquo;t want any one to hear me. Do you mind if I come in and
talk? Are you very sleepy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a bit sleepy. Come in, of course. I want
especially to see you. What is the matter, Vic? You have looked
so anxious all the afternoon, and not a bit like yourself. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all Aunt Sophia,&rdquo; said Victoria, curling
herself up on the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sophia! Why, what has she been saying? I thought
you were too busy, when you were with her, to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Aunt Sophia ever too busy to say what she wants
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;But what was it about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Carney, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor laughed. &ldquo;Surely, my dear child, you are not
staying up half the night just because Aunt Sophia sees fit to
criticise Dave Carney? If I minded her as much as that, I should
never sleep a wink after she had been talking about poor B.
Lafferty, who, by the way, declares that she is going to-morrow
&lsquo;for certain sure!&rsquo; What does she say about
Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she doesn&rsquo;t think he is honest, because she
was sure she saw him going into a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop. As if
that proved anything! She might just as well say that I
wasn&rsquo;t, because I sold the gold and the&mdash;&rdquo;
Victoria paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite the same thing,&rdquo; said Honor, &ldquo;for
you really had the things to sell; but I can&rsquo;t imagine
where Dave Carney gets anything to pawn. But I can&rsquo;t think
why you are so worried, Vic. Aunt Sophia has been saying that
sort of thing all our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that. It isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> I am
worried about, of course, Honor. She was speaking about something
else, that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of before. Something about
Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; asked Honor, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she said first that she was selfish and
extravagant, and then&mdash;I really hate to repeat it, Honor,
for it doesn&rsquo;t seem a bit nice, but I must tell
you&mdash;then she said it didn&rsquo;t make so much difference
as she was going to marry a rich man, or &lsquo;make a good
match,&rsquo; as she expressed it. Don&rsquo;t you think it was
rather disagreeable for Aunt Sophia to say that? And whom
<i>do</i> you suppose she meant, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Madison, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor&rsquo;s voice was so peculiar that Victoria glanced at
her sharply, but it was too dark in the room for her to see her
face very clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Madison; but I don&rsquo;t see how you
happened to guess it so quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefly because there is no one else whom Aunt Sophia
could possibly mean. There isn&rsquo;t another man in the
neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Honor, have you noticed anything? Do you think
that Katherine&mdash;well, that she cares for him? Of course he
likes her, he couldn&rsquo;t help liking her, but&mdash;oh, I
don&rsquo;t know! It doesn&rsquo;t seem a bit nice to talk about
Katherine this way, and I wish Aunt Sophia hadn&rsquo;t said
anything. I <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>told her that probably they were just good friends, and
she said that was almost impossible. Don&rsquo;t you think that
is a most ridiculous idea, Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very ridiculous, and I agree with you that it
isn&rsquo;t very nice to talk about it. I know lots of girls do,
and we should be considered very old-fashioned and peculiar not
to want to. We are different from most girls, and I think we feel
differently about those things. So don&rsquo;t let us say any
more, Vic, unless Katherine wants to speak about it
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is nothing for us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Honor, very quietly, &ldquo;there is
nothing for us to do.&rdquo; And then, very much to the surprise
of Victoria, she hid her face in the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, are you so sleepy, Honor?&rdquo; asked the younger
sister. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look so. What is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not really sleepy, but&mdash;but I think
we have talked long enough, Vicky dear! If you don&rsquo;t mind,
I would rather not say any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t been here more than fifteen
minutes, Honor, and there is something else that I thought of
telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, please, dear. I would rather not <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>talk any
more to-night, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just as you say, of course!&rdquo; said Victoria,
as she got up. &ldquo;I think you are very queer, though. You
said you were glad to see me and that you wanted to talk about
something yourself, and now, almost right away, you tell me to
go! What did you want to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be huffy, dear! I know I did want to, but
really, I can&rsquo;t talk about anything more to-night.
I&mdash;I have a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor thing!&rdquo; cried Victoria, her
resentment fading at once. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me so
before? I thought you looked different from usual. Can&rsquo;t I
do anything for you? It was a shame for me to come and bother
you, but you seemed glad to have me when I came. Shall I bathe
your head with cologne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you. If I once get asleep, I shall be all
right, and it is really pretty late, Vic. It is nearly twelve
o&rsquo;clock. You had better go to bed right away. Good night,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor was almost pushing her sister out of the room as she
spoke, and Victoria heard her close and lock the door behind
her.</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>&ldquo;If Honor isn&rsquo;t too funny!&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;Locking me out, actually! Well, if she
isn&rsquo;t going to worry, there is no need of my doing so.
People never do what you expect them to. Honor is certainly
queer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath
way&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why, how very peculiar! I am sure I didn&rsquo;t leave my door
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had reached her own room and paused before the open door.
She had certainly not left it open, because of the draught which
Sophy would have been in between it and the window. Perhaps the
breeze had blown it open, and yet that did not seem possible, for
the night was a still one, and it seemed to be growing warmer.
She went into the room and found Sophy sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that you, Vic?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad! Have you just come up? And did you meet
Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you must be dreaming! Of course I
didn&rsquo;t meet Dave. It is the middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dave just went through here,&rdquo; said Sophy.
&ldquo;I heard a sound that woke me up, and when I opened my eyes
there was Dave just going out the door. Didn&rsquo;t you see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Dearest, I know you have been dreaming,&rdquo;
said Victoria, sitting down beside her little sister and taking
her hand. &ldquo;I tell you, it is after twelve o&rsquo;clock,
and Dave is probably sound asleep in his room at the barn. You
know he is never upstairs here, and of course he wouldn&rsquo;t
be going through our room at any hour. You have such vivid dreams
sometimes, Sophy. Don&rsquo;t you remember the one about the pony
that you thought was here in the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy laughed. &ldquo;That was a funny one,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and the other about the animals that could talk, after
Peter had been reading those stories to me. Well, perhaps
you&rsquo;re right, Vic, and this was a dream about Dave, but it
was a very clear one, and I was frightened when I woke up and you
weren&rsquo;t here. Are you going to bed now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very quickly, and you must try to go to sleep
right away, it is so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy obediently lay down and was soon fast asleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny how the child dreams,&rdquo; thought Victoria,
&ldquo;and it was funny, too, that I should have left the door
open. Something must have blown down in the breeze and waked her
up, and that <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>was the noise she heard. Yes, here is a photograph on
the floor, and this little book that was near the edge of my
table. It must have been a pretty strong wind to blow that off,
and yet it seems so warm now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before long Victoria was herself asleep, having dismissed
her cares and anxieties with the determination to think no more
about them. If Honor was not troubled by them, why should she
be?</p>
<p>It seemed to Victoria that she had been asleep but a few
moments when she was awakened by a sharp and excited rapping upon
her door. It must be morning, however, for instead of the moon
which had lighted her room when she went to sleep, the sun was
now shining in the heavens, already quite high and well advanced
upon his day&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic,&rdquo; said Honor&rsquo;s voice in the hall,
&ldquo;open your door quickly! The most dreadful thing has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria sprang to let her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house has been robbed,&rdquo; said Honor.
&ldquo;Burglars have been here, and everything downstairs has
been ransacked! Oh, Vic, isn&rsquo;t it too dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>Victoria was speechless with surprise and
consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a noise in the night,&rdquo;
continued Honor; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep very well, and I
thought of going down to the dining-room to get a glass of water.
Oh, Vic, suppose I had! I should have met them! Instead, I took
some water from the pitcher in my room, and I remember setting
the pitcher down on the floor with quite a hard thump. It was
after that, I think, that I heard a sound like a door shutting.
It grew very warm in the night, and I opened my window with quite
a noise. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it had frightened them
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they taken much?&rdquo; asked Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, for everything is in confusion.
Blanch came up to tell me. The silver was most of it in my room,
fortunately. It is a good thing we are in the habit of bringing
it up every night. How do you suppose they got in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine. Do you remember, Honor, that Katherine
thought she heard some one in the shrubbery? I do wonder if the
burglar was hiding there! How perfectly horrible it
seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we walked about there looking for him! <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>I must go
up and tell Katherine, and when you are dressed, we will go down
and make a careful search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sophy had waked up, and, hearing the news,
could scarcely control her excitement. She flew about the room,
constantly getting into Victoria&rsquo;s way, begging to be
helped with her innumerable buttons, and asking a thousand
questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a buggler, Vic?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I
always thought a buggler was some kind of a bug, like a buffalo
bug, or something of that sort. Is it really a real live man? And
what did he want in our house? And how did he get in, Vic, with
the doors all locked and bolted? I say, Vic, how did he get
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Vic. &ldquo;Sophy, do
please get out of my way! I&rsquo;m in such a hurry. Go stand by
the window, there&rsquo;s a good girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you tell me what a buggler is?&rdquo;
pleaded Sophy. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stir if you&rsquo;ll only
tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a robber. Do you know what that
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. That is a sensible name. Any one would
know that a robber robs, but a buggler!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>&ldquo;A buggler doesn&rsquo;t bug,&rdquo; said
Victoria, laughing in spite of her hurry and dismay. &ldquo;Let
me tell you that it is <i>burglar</i>, and not
buggler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy had by this time taken up her station by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Vic,&rdquo; she cried, looking out, &ldquo;did you
know that all the vines are torn round this window? They&rsquo;re
just streaming! What do you s&rsquo;pose has made &rsquo;em
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria ran to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t so last night,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Sophy, it looks exactly as if some one had climbed up
here. Do you think the man could possibly have come in this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood by the window, reviewing hastily in her mind the
events of the night. She had sat there for a long time and then
had left the room. She had been absent not more than fifteen or
twenty minutes, and when she came back the door was open. It gave
her a most uncomfortable sensation to feel that the robber had
actually been in her very room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a bit,&rdquo; said Sophy.
&ldquo;You know I dreamed Dave Carney went through the
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>So
she had! Perhaps&mdash;perhaps, after all, it had not been a
dream! Victoria felt a sudden and unaccountable weakness, and she
was forced to sit down for a moment. Surely it could not have
been Dave Carney who had thus entered the house of his
benefactors!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say
anything about that dream, will you? Promise me that you
won&rsquo;t tell any one that you dreamed that about
Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Vic; I won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t want me
to; but why not? Why can&rsquo;t I tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have good reasons, Sophy dear, but I haven&rsquo;t
time to explain them now; but you know it is fun to have a secret
with me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Sophy, greatly pleased with
the idea. &ldquo;Yes, I do love secrets with you, Vic. I&rsquo;ll
never tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Downstairs all was in confusion. The dining-room had
apparently been entered first, for the most thorough work had
been done here. Drawers stood open, closets and sideboard were in
confusion. The china had been left untouched, but the silver
candlesticks and the old snuffers with their tray were gone, and
some small articles in silver <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>and plated ware which had not been
carried upstairs at night with the table silver and the
service.</p>
<p>A clock, which had stood upon the dining-room mantel-shelf,
had been carried into the parlor and left there. No doubt the man
or men had been frightened off by the noise which Honor made when
she set down her pitcher and afterwards opened her window, for
her room was over the parlor. They had gone out by way of the
front door, for it was found unbolted. No other door or window
had been disturbed, and it was reasonable to suppose that one man
had entered by way of Victoria&rsquo;s room and had then opened
the front door to the others, if others there were.</p>
<p>It was astonishing that the man&mdash;who no doubt was the one
in the shrubbery whom Katherine had heard&mdash;should have
chosen the exact time during which Victoria was absent from the
room to climb up over the dining-room window, and that he had not
seen Victoria, when she was sitting in her room, as she said she
had been doing for more than an hour. It could only be explained
by the fact that she had sat in a low chair a little back from
the window, and completely in the shadow. He had probably been <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>watching
from the shrubbery, and, not seeing any one and finding the
window conveniently open, had determined to enter in that way,
whatever his previous plans may have been; and he had chosen
exactly the right moment for doing it.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, the Starrs were greatly excited by this
occurrence, and none more so than Mrs. Wentworth Ward. She quite
resented the fact that she had slept peacefully and unconsciously
through the whole episode, and seemed to take it as a personal
grievance that she had not awakened and descended in person to
confront the burglar. The opportunity for that having passed by,
she consoled herself by making active investigations into the
amount of loss that had been sustained by her nieces, and by
trying to fit the cap of guilt upon some member of the
household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is absurd to think the man got in through
Victoria&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It could not be!
Her room is directly next to mine, and I should have heard him. I
am a very light sleeper, I assure you. Besides, how could he have
had the luck to choose the very time of all others when Victoria
was out of the room? What if the vines are torn? That proves
nothing. No, no! <a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>Depend upon it, some one <i>in this house</i> opened
the front door and let them in. You know very little about that
extremely ignorant maid of yours. I have no doubt she was an
accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had finished breakfast when Mrs. Ward made this statement
and were again in the parlor, and while they were talking, Mr.
Madison was seen approaching the house. He had come to ask Honor
and Katherine to go out on the river with his sister and himself
that afternoon.</p>
<p>When he came in, Victoria glanced quickly from one sister to
the other. She was surprised to see that Honor was the one who
looked embarrassed. Her color certainly changed, and her manner
was somewhat stiff. Katherine, on the contrary, greeted the
newcomer with her customary frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just the very one we need,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Here we lone, lorn women&mdash;the only man in the family
laid up with a broken leg&mdash;have been robbed! The only wonder
is that we were not murdered as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told him the history of the night, and Madison&rsquo;s
advice was that the matter should be placed in the hands of
detectives at once. He <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>offered to do it for them, and
thought it probable that their property would be recovered, as
such articles as the clock, and various other things that had
been taken from the parlor, would be of no use to the burglars
unless they were pawned. The silver candlesticks, on the
contrary, could be melted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it couldn&rsquo;t have been a very experienced
thief,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;An old hand would have known
better than to take plated things, as you say some of them were.
However, we will tell the whole story to the detective. Suppose
you leave things here just as they are. I will bring a man out
from Boston in the first train I can get. I could telegraph, I
suppose, for one to come, but it is just as well to move quietly
in these matters, and perhaps it will not take any longer to go
to town. I am inclined myself to the theory that the man came in
the second-story window. The open door which Miss Victoria found,
and the torn vines seem to point to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do <i>not</i> agree with you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wentworth Ward. &ldquo;My nieces, Mr. Madison, quite against my
better judgment, have insisted upon <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>employing two very inferior
servants. One is the kitchen maid, who knows absolutely
nothing&mdash;in fact, to use a slang expression to which I
seriously object&mdash;is as green as the island she came from.
The other is a farm boy, whom they picked up no one knows where.
I have no doubt that he could give some information in regard to
this robbery. Ellen Higgins, my own maid, who is here, tells me
that this boy is behaving most unaccountably this morning. When
he heard of the robbery, he first became very pale indeed, and
then turned very red, and since then he has shown every evidence
of guilt. In addition to this, with my own eyes I saw him going
into a Boston pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop a day or two ago, as I told
my niece Victoria only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will tell all that to the detectives,&rdquo;
said Madison. &ldquo;They will soon find out who the guilty one
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, his glance fell upon Victoria. At the mention of
Dave Carney she too had become very white. She was thinking of
Sophy&rsquo;s dream. She almost wished that she could get speech
with Roger Madison alone. She should like to tell him the whole
story and ask him if there <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>were not some way of saving Dave
from the iron hand of the law. She felt that if he were arrested,
it would stain his reputation forever.</p>
<p>She did not for a moment believe that he was guilty, and
yet&mdash;there was Sophy&rsquo;s dream! Was it her duty to tell
Mr. Madison this, or not? She would certainly not give her Aunt
Sophia the benefit of the information. In the meantime Peter
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know more about Dave Carney than any of you,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t try to make me think that
he had anything to do with it. I&rsquo;ve been with him a lot,
and I know him, and nobody has any right to say anything about
him in connection with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But confidently as Peter spoke he too felt uneasy, for he
distinctly remembered the occasion of his first meeting with
Carney.</p>
<p>He had been stealing apples!</p>
<h2><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE RIVER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Victoria</span> concluded that if she
wished to save Dave Carney, her best course was to say nothing to
Mr. Madison. He would not be influenced by any feeling of pity
for Dave, she feared, and if he knew that Sophy had imagined that
the boy passed through the room, he would consider it his duty to
tell the detective of the fact.</p>
<p>Victoria remembered that Sophy had been very confident when
the incident occurred that she had not been dreaming, and the
torn vines and the open door proved conclusively that some one
had climbed in at the window. Victoria in her own mind was almost
if not entirely convinced that it was Carney, but there was
nothing to cause any one else to suspect him,&mdash;with the
exception of her aunt, who suspected him on principle,&mdash;and
if Victoria remained silent, she hoped that the boy would
escape.</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>But
then, again, was this course right? If Carney were so depraved as
to steal from the family who had treated him with such kindness,
surely it was their duty to deliver him into the hands of
justice. Victoria knew that this would be Roger Madison&rsquo;s
opinion. She had just determined to say nothing and to allow
matters to take their course without interference from her, when
something which Peter said to her again unsettled her.</p>
<p>The boy was in the hammock, which was hung across one end of
the piazza directly in front of the dining-room window. Seeing
Victoria within, where she was busily washing the breakfast
dishes, he called to her to come to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Victoria, appearing on
the other side of the wire screen at the window, with a saucer in
her hand which she was vigorously wiping with a crash towel.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully busy, Peter. It is ironing day, you
know, and Honor and Katherine are making the beds, so I have to
do the breakfast things alone. Sophy is helping me, but&mdash;you
know what that means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; said Peter, raising
himself on one arm, and lowering his voice to a <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>mysterious
whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really very important, Vic. About last
night, you know. Can&rsquo;t you come out here a minute? Is any
one else in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Sophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Aunt Sophia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she is upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then do come out, quick! It&rsquo;s a good chance.
And shut that window. I don&rsquo;t want any one inside to hear
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria saw that he had really something of importance to
communicate, so, leaving several articles upon the tray for Sophy
to wipe during her absence, and giving her strict injunctions to
be careful, she closed the dining-room window, and went around
through the door to Peter on the piazza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Carney this morning?&rdquo; he asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>Victoria started. The mention of Carney&rsquo;s name fitted so
exactly with her own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic, do you think it could have been he? I wasn&rsquo;t
going to let on to Aunt Sophia that I thought it for a minute,
but I do feel kind of shaky about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>&ldquo;Why, Peter, do you really?&rdquo; said Victoria.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it&mdash;at least, why should he have
chosen that way of letting the burglars in? If it was really Dave
who opened the door, I should think he could have found some
other way of doing it. He is around the kitchen so much, he might
have left a window unbolted, or something of that sort. It would
have been easier than climbing up to my room. And now I come to
think of it, Dave knew that was my room. He came up there once,
to hang my book shelves. He never would have been so stupid as to
climb in that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s tone expressed a sense of relief. She had not
thought of this before. She almost forgot her surprise at
Peter&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Vic,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;I must tell
you something I have never told anybody, and it kind of bothers
me. I never told you what Carney was doing when I first saw
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Was it anything wrong, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was&mdash;now don&rsquo;t you tell any one, Vic,
unless we decide that we had better. Now mind you
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. Hurry, for I hear Sophy
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>&ldquo;He was stealing apples from a barrel outside of
a provision store in Fordham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was! I caught him at it. He said he
hadn&rsquo;t any money to buy anything to eat, and he was awfully
hungry, so I gave him some. And then he helped me,&mdash;in that
fight, you know,&mdash;and he came home with me.&rdquo; Peter
could not yet endure to mention the name of Sirius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed like such a nice fellow,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and I thought it would be a shame to give him a bad name
by saying he&rsquo;d been stealing. I knew Honor would never have
him here if I did, so I just kept quiet about that, and
didn&rsquo;t even tell you, but I thought I had better to-day. I
don&rsquo;t believe for a minute, though, that he had anything to
do with the robbery. I can&rsquo;t think it, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; said Victoria,
again remembering Sophy&rsquo;s so-called dream.</p>
<p>At that moment a loud crash sounded from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; cried Victoria, running into the house;
&ldquo;I do believe Sophy has broken something!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>She
found her small sister gazing in dismay at the floor, which was
strewn with broken glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant to!&rdquo; she wailed, when she saw
Victoria. &ldquo;Indeed, Vic, I never meant to! I was only going
to help you carry the tumblers to the china closet, and they all
began to slip, and slide, and tumble off the tray. Is that the
reason they&rsquo;re called tumblers, Vic? Because they always
tumble off? I never touched a tumbler when it didn&rsquo;t
tumble. Tell me, Vic, is it? Oh, I&rsquo;m awful sorry, but I was
only helping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were, but, oh dear!&rdquo; said Victoria,
hurrying away for the dust-pan and brush with which to sweep up
the broken glass. &ldquo;This is a day of misfortunes! What the
burglars have left you have broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not everything, Vic! How can you say so?
There&rsquo;s all the china, dishes, and plates, and cups and
saucers, and everything. I haven&rsquo;t broken those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and please don&rsquo;t try to,&rdquo; said her
sister, struggling to remain calm and not to scold Sophy. A dozen
good tumblers in atoms, and how could they spare the money to buy
more?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never tried to!&rdquo; cried Sophy, bursting into <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>tears and
burying her face in a dish-towel. &ldquo;Oh, how can you say so?
I never tried to break &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for the first time in her life, Victoria turned a deaf ear
to Sophy&rsquo;s lamentations, and the child fled upstairs to
Honor for consolation. She found her eldest sister in her own
room. She was standing in the middle of the floor and she was
directly confronted by B. Lafferty, who, with her hands on her
hips, was haranguing her young mistress with all the eloquence at
her command.</p>
<p>Sophy forgot her own grievance in wonder as to what Blanch
could be talking about, and sidling up to Honor, she dried her
tears and listened, her big brown eyes fastened upon the crimson
countenance of the housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell yer, I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; ter go this very
minute!&rdquo; said Blanch. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; ter
stay where insults is heaped upon me. I&rsquo;ve put up with the
imperence of that proud an&rsquo; hotty girl long enough.
Sayin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s allus lived on Beacon Street an&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t never lived in the country afore! An&rsquo; has allus
been in the house with three others, a cook, a laundress,
an&rsquo; an upstairs girl! An&rsquo; now she an&rsquo; yer aunt
be afther sayin&rsquo; as it was me as let in the burglars,
an&rsquo; me as sound asleep as anything an&rsquo; <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>adreamin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the ould counthry, an niver a
word did I hear of any burglars till I come down this
mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; was agoin&rsquo; ter set the table for
breakfast, an&rsquo; lo an&rsquo; behold, all the drawers
an&rsquo; the closets was astandin&rsquo; open an&rsquo; I not
knowin&rsquo; at all what it all mint. An&rsquo; yer know yerself
as Miss Vic&rsquo;s windy and doore was astandin&rsquo; wide open
an&rsquo; the burglar walked in that way as sure as anything,
an&rsquo; they be afther sayin&rsquo; as it was me or young Dave
Carney as let &rsquo;em in, as honest a young feller as iver I
seen. Oh, I tell yer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait a minute, Blanch,&rdquo; interposed Honor.
&ldquo;<i>I</i> do not think that you had anything to do with the
robbery. Neither do my sisters, and we are the ones to whom you
are accountable. If you go away in the next train, as you
threaten to do, you will make others suspect you as well as my
aunt. It will look exactly as if you were afraid of being caught
and were running off. The detective who is coming out this
morning will certainly say that you had something to do with it
if he finds that you have gone, whereas if you stay quietly here
and go about your work as usual, no one will dream of accusing
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an amount of common sense in this <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>statement
which B. Lafferty, excited though she was, could not fail to
recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay till
termorrow, but longer than that I couldn&rsquo;t put up with that
girl from Beacon Street. It&rsquo;s long enough I&rsquo;ve been
afther standin&rsquo; it, and me keepin&rsquo; stiddy company
with a widder man an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; the chance to git
married any day I&rsquo;ll set!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying she departed to the kitchen, leaving her
mistress, who had recently been having a discussion with her
aunt, strongly of the opinion that residents of Beacon Street
were indeed difficult to live with.</p>
<p>It was not long before Roger Madison returned, bringing with
him a detective. The man carefully examined the premises, took a
list of the missing articles with an exact description of them
all, and interviewed each member of the household.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no doubt that the person whom Katherine had
heard in the shrubbery had entered through the window in
Victoria&rsquo;s room. Although Mrs. Wentworth Ward named her
suspicions of both Blanch and Dave Carney to the detective, he
did not seem inclined to agree with her in regard to the former.
Honor had been given a very good <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>account of the Irishwoman&rsquo;s
honesty when she engaged her, and there had been nothing since
she lived with them to cause her to doubt it.</p>
<p>As to Carney, that was a different matter. When the detective
questioned him, he became very much confused and gave most
unsatisfactory replies; and yet it seemed impossible that a boy
who was familiar with the house, and knew that two members of the
family occupied the room over the dining-room, should have chosen
that means of entering. The detective could determine nothing as
yet.</p>
<p>After he had gone back to Boston, and the affairs of the
family had resumed their accustomed regularity, Victoria&rsquo;s
thoughts reverted to the matter which had been troubling her the
evening before. There seemed to be no one to whom she could speak
upon the subject. She attempted to draw Honor into conversation
about it, but with no result. Honor replied rather shortly that
her mind was too much occupied with the robbery to think of
anything else. Naturally, to speak to Katherine was out of the
question, and after all, said Victoria to herself, why was it
necessary to speak to any one? It was only the foolish habit that
they all had of <a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>talking over their troubles together, that made her
anxious to do so on this occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may just as well learn to do without it,&rdquo;
thought she. &ldquo;It is a good chance to begin. I have several
things on my mind now. Katherine, the etchings, and Dave. Secrets
and responsibilities seem to be multiplying. I think I&rsquo;ll
slip off to the grove and have a good think all to
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not so easy of accomplishment as might appear at
first sight, but after having promised Aunt Sophia that the
afternoon should be devoted to her correspondence, and having
established Peter and Sophy at a game of halma, and leaving
Katherine at the piano and Honor at the sewing-machine, Victoria
departed to the pine grove.</p>
<p>It was a warm day, and now at noon the sun shone down with
oppressive heat. The weather, which had been unusually cool
during the past few days for the season of the year, had suddenly
changed, and a hot wave had reached that part of the country and
was about to envelop them with its relentless intensity. There
was not a breath of air in the grove, and the aromatic smell of
the pine needles which covered the ground like a thick carpet
seemed to add to the heat.</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>Victoria wondered if it would be cooler on the river,
drawn up in the shadow of the bank. She went to the little
boathouse and loosing the old boat, she stepped into it and
pushed out into midstream. Then with one oar she paddled close up
to shore and made herself fast to a convenient stump.</p>
<p>The boat was not a very comfortable craft, and it was inclined
to leak, but by sitting with her feet carefully tucked to one
side, she managed to avoid the pools of water in the bottom. The
Starrs had long wished for a canoe, and their father had intended
to buy one for them. After his death there was no money with
which to get it, although Katherine had made known her intention
more than once of buying one as soon as she had saved enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she will, though,&rdquo; said
Victoria to herself, as she leaned her head upon her hands and
prepared for a &ldquo;good think.&rdquo; &ldquo;I really believe
Katherine is growing a tiny mite more economical. She
hasn&rsquo;t bought anything at all, lately. I wonder if it is
because of her interest in her music and&mdash;and the
Madisons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name had scarcely crossed her mind when <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>she was
startled by a voice that seemed to be very close to her. She had
been so absorbed in her thoughts that she had not heard the
gentle dip of a paddle nor the slight sound in the water of an
approaching canoe. Turning quickly, she found that Roger Madison
had drawn up directly alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I startle you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I beg your
pardon. I thought you would hear me coming. No, to be quite
truthful, I didn&rsquo;t really think so. I wanted to catch you,
and not give you a chance to run away from me, as usual. No, you
needn&rsquo;t look up there,&rdquo; he added, seeing that
Victoria&rsquo;s glance involuntarily sought the river bank,
which was high and particularly steep at this point. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t possibly climb up there, if you were to try,
without falling back into the river, and I should have to rescue
you from a watery grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A muddy one, I think,&rdquo; said Victoria, laughing in
spite of her desire for flight. She could not help liking Roger
Madison, much as she wished to avoid him. She had liked him that
memorable day in the picture store; and since then what a good
friend he had proved himself <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>to be! He had saved Peter&rsquo;s
life, he had come again and again to see the boy, and had done
much, Victoria felt confident, to help him to bear his accident
patiently; and now to-day he had taken all this trouble in regard
to the robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long been waiting for this chance,&rdquo; said
Madison; &ldquo;and, now that it has come, I intend to make the
most of it, and you shall not be allowed to escape until you have
explained matters. I felt that I was staying out of town for some
good reason to-day, and now it is explained. It was to see you. I
want to know why you always try to avoid me. Have I ever done
anything to make you dislike me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied Victoria, with such emphasis that
there was no doubting her sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you run away whenever I come within
speaking distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would know,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;It is because you were the man who bought that
etching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see the connection,&rdquo; said
Roger. &ldquo;Why should that make you wish to avoid me? You
didn&rsquo;t cheat me. The etching was worth all I gave you for
it. It was simply a matter of <a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>business. If you feel that you must
avoid all the people you have ever transacted any business
with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> worth all that you gave me
for it,&rdquo; cried Victoria, turning towards him her flushed
and troubled face, and, in her excitement, allowing her feet to
slip down into the bottom of the boat. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t!
That is just it! You gave me more than you should have done; and
I accepted it, which was dreadful! When I came home and told the
girls about it, Honor hoped that I should never see you again.
She felt very badly about it, and so did I. I didn&rsquo;t dare
tell them that it was you. That is the reason I ran away the day
we went to call on your sister and I saw you in the parlor. The
girls couldn&rsquo;t understand it, and have never been able to
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they don&rsquo;t know it yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I have never dared tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t tell them now, will you? It might
prejudice them against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t if I can help it,&rdquo; said Victoria.
&ldquo;They asked me last night about it, and said that Sophy
repeated something I said yesterday afternoon. I think I should
have told them then if Katherine <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>hadn&rsquo;t heard that noise in the
shrubbery just at that minute, and we were
interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wish you would explain why you feel so,&rdquo;
said Roger, with a puzzled expression upon his face. &ldquo;Why
did you wish to avoid me? Why did you never wish to see me again?
I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, you are very dense!&rdquo; exclaimed Victoria.
&ldquo;It is as simple as possible, I&rsquo;m sure! In the first
place, I took ten dollars more from you, or five dollars at
least, than I should have done, because there was no reason why
you should give me more than you would have paid in the store.
Then, it&mdash;well, Honor felt dreadfully about having let me go
to Boston to sell those etchings, and said I ought not to have
gone alone, and you, &lsquo;the young man,&rsquo; would think it
very strange that I was allowed to go when I was so young, and
she should have gone with me. That is the reason she hoped we
should never see you again. Then when you came here to live I
couldn&rsquo;t tell her that you were the one, because she had
felt uncomfortable about calling on your sister
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Madison. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she
like our looks?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>&ldquo;Oh, not that at all! Because we are so poor and
are working for our living. She felt that you were strangers and
perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t understand, and perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t
want us to call upon you or know you. You see, we haven&rsquo;t
always been so, and it makes it harder. We had great difficulty,
Katherine and I, in getting her to go, and when she finally did
and liked you all so much I couldn&rsquo;t bear to spoil it by
telling her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t
spoil it now by telling her, either, because&mdash;well, we are
such capital friends now and it might make a difference. Wait
until&mdash;until I know her better. Then we will tell her, you
and I together, and have a good laugh over it. But I want to say
something to you, Miss Victoria. You needn&rsquo;t feel in that
way about the etching. I happen to know that the picture dealer
sold the others for thirty-five dollars each, and mine gave so
much pleasure to my sister, to whom I gave it, that it is worth
far more to me. I have never regretted buying it, I assure you.
And I also want to tell you how much we admire and respect you
for the way in which you have all done. So far from our not
understanding, we had heard about you <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>before we came, and were most
anxious to meet you. We feel proud to know you. Would you mind
shaking hands with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria promptly extended her hand, which was warmly grasped
by the occupant of the other boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t run away any more,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed! I&rsquo;m thankful I don&rsquo;t have to.
You have done me a lot of good. It is one of the things I came
down here to think over. You see I had no one to speak to about
it, and I really seem to need some one always to talk things over
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great comfort. My sister and I have that habit,
too. Can&rsquo;t you talk the other &lsquo;things&rsquo; over
with me? You say this was one of them, so there must be
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria blushed and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The others I shall have
to keep to myself&mdash;except Dave Carney. I could consult you
about him, but I think I had better not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean in connection with the robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and yet I don&rsquo;t want to put it into <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>words. I
wish I could have a little talk with Dave myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;It
would be more efficacious than anything I could do. You might
induce him to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria was silent for a moment. Then she suddenly looked at
her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am positively sitting with my feet in the
river!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This leaky old boat is no good at
all, and my shoes are soaking wet. I shall have to go right in
and change them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall have to allow you to go under those
circumstances,&rdquo; said Roger, as he pushed out of the way and
watched her unfasten her boat, in the doing of which she scorned
his proffered assistance. &ldquo;But I am glad we have had this
explanation. You won&rsquo;t run away from me any more, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Victoria, smiling brightly at him and
disappearing within the shelter of the old boathouse. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t run away from you any more.&rdquo;</p>

320</span>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MRS. WENTWORTH WARD CHANGES HER
OPINION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Before</span> I&rsquo;d be afraid
of a toad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Peter, you&rsquo;re not afraid of
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re afraid of everything, so there&rsquo;s
the difference. I never saw such a girl. Snakes, and lizards, and
toads, and spiders, and wasps&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a thing
you&rsquo;re not afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is, too!&rdquo; said Sophy, indignantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of flies or butterflies or
caterpillars&mdash;yes, I am afraid of caterpillars.
They&rsquo;re so fuzzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see there is hardly anything! As for flies
and butterflies, why, of course a baby wouldn&rsquo;t mind
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use of those other things, Peter?
What&rsquo;s the use of wasps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasps! Why, they&rsquo;re <i>very</i> useful. They
don&rsquo;t hurt you unless you bother them, and they eat up
slugs, and some kinds of caterpillars.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;Well, wasps are very frightening, I think, even
if they are useful, and so are hop toads, and hop toads are so
ugly! Oh, here comes one now! Go away, you horrid, naughty
toad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter and Sophy were on the piazza in the early twilight.
Honor and Katherine were with the Madisons on the river, enjoying
a picnic tea. Supper at Glen Arden was over, and Mrs. Wentworth
Ward had walked to the village for her
&ldquo;constitutional,&rdquo; which the hot weather had prevented
during the day. Victoria had gone in search of Dave Carney, whom
she thought she should be apt to find at liberty at this hour. It
was the evening of the day upon which the robbery had been
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use in an ugly toad, Peter,&rdquo;
continued Sophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed there is!&rdquo; said her brother, in a tone of
marked masculine superiority. &ldquo;That just shows how little
you know about things. Toads are regular policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! What do you mean? Do they arrest
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, you goosie! But they arrest insects.
If you put toads into hotbeds or <a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>cold-frames, they&rsquo;ll eat up
all the bugs and worms that come after the plants. They keep
regular guard, just as policemen do. There, do you hear that tree
toad now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy listened to the shrill song of the little creature that
appeared to be sitting upon the branch of a tree close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re as good as hop toads, for they eat
caterpillars, and worms, and hateful flies that lay their eggs
under the bark of the trees, and would eat up the trees if it
were not for the toads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they eat caterpillars as well as the
wasps,&rdquo; said Sophy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so disagreeable.
Why do you suppose caterpillars were made, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. To eat up
something else, I suppose, and to be food for toads. I&rsquo;ll
tell you another funny thing about hop toads. They never will
touch a dead insect or bug or anything. They&rsquo;ll only catch
them alive. Isn&rsquo;t that queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much you do know, Peter!&rdquo; said his sister,
admiringly. &ldquo;I wish I knew as much as you do. I&rsquo;m
going to keep asking questions all my life, and then perhaps some
day I shall know as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never will, for you are only a girl, and I&rsquo;m
<a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>a boy.
You&rsquo;ll never know as much as I do, for I shall always keep
ahead of you. First place, I&rsquo;m nearly five years older than
you, and then, I&rsquo;m a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you think it&rsquo;s very grand to be a
boy,&rdquo; said Sophy, still keeping a watchful eye upon the
extremely active hop toad which with other members of its family
had come forth from beneath the piazza for a hop in the evening
air; &ldquo;but some girls know a good deal. I was asking Mr.
Madison about it the other day, and he said some girls knew as
much as boys did, and when they grew up some women knew as much
as some men. I think Mr. Madison likes girls better than you do,
Peter. I think he likes Honor and Katherine very much indeed. He
is always coming here to get them to go somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he is,&rdquo; rejoined Peter. &ldquo;I like Mr.
Madison ever so much, and I think he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow,
and I like the way he talks, usually, but he&rsquo;s awfully
silly about girls. We were having such an interesting talk the
other day about animals and birds when Honor happened to come
along, and he stopped right off short and walked off with her up
to the house, and never came back to the trees <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>where we
were sitting at all! Oh, he&rsquo;s downright silly about girls,
and I don&rsquo;t think you had better go by what he says about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dialogue was interrupted at this point by Victoria. She
came up across the grass from the barn to the steps at the end of
the piazza. There she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;have you seen Dave
lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen him since&mdash;oh, I
can&rsquo;t think when it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and remember. I want to know
particularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was before dinner. I saw him go across the
garden towards the Ashmont road. I wondered where he was
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going around to the kitchen for a
minute,&rdquo; said Victoria, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was absent for five or ten minutes. When she returned, it
was with a very grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much
afraid Dave has run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanch says he hasn&rsquo;t been in the kitchen since
breakfast time. After the detective was here she saw him come out
of the barn in very old clothes, <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>and she thought he was going out to
the farthest field to work. He went over in that
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, eagerly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the way I saw him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come in to dinner, and when she asked
Wilson, the man who is working here to-day, you know, where he
was, Wilson said that Dave said he had to go down to Fordham to
get something, and he wouldn&rsquo;t be home to dinner. Wilson
supposed he was just going to take his noon hour to go down
there, but he has never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they tell us before?&rdquo; asked
Peter, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Victoria.
&ldquo;You know what B. Lafferty is. She is dreadfully stupid
about such things, and when I said something about it,&mdash;that
she ought to have told us,&mdash;she said she wasn&rsquo;t going
to let on to that proud and haughty person from Beacon Street
that her suspicions were correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she mean Aunt Sophia?&rdquo; asked Sophy, who had
forgotten her fear of the toads and was listening with eager
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she meant Ellen Higgins, I suppose. Both Ellen and
Aunt Sophia think that Dave <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>had something to do with the
robbery; and, do you know, Peter, it looks very much like it, now
that Dave has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, very solemnly, &ldquo;it really
does. Oh, Vic, I never should have believed it of him, should
you? I liked him so much. I can&rsquo;t think so even now. I
believe we&rsquo;ll find out yet that he didn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with it. Maybe he was taken ill somewhere, or
something has happened, and he can&rsquo;t get back. I
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> believe it was he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other members of the family did not agree with Peter.
When they heard the news of Carney&rsquo;s disappearance, they
looked at one another with troubled faces. They had all liked the
lad; and the discovery that he had deceived them and had treated
them with such base ingratitude, after all that had been done for
him, filled them with disappointment and real sorrow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wentworth Ward was, of course, triumphant. She plumed
herself upon her superior cleverness in having suspected the boy
from the first; and she soundly berated the detective for having
neglected to arrest him at once. Now the thief had escaped, and
there was no knowing when he <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>would be found. With this exception,
therefore, the Starrs awaited further developments with
ill-concealed anxiety.</p>
<p>Honor and Katherine were very busy during these summer days;
and even the intense heat which was raging at present did not
keep them from their work. As soon as school had come to an
end,&mdash;early in June,&mdash;they began upon their preserving.
Glen Arden was famous for its currants and cherries, as well as
for its apple and pear trees. As each fruit ripened, the huge
kettle was brought out, a quantity of sugar ordered, and every
available hand was brought into service.</p>
<p>Miss Madison, coming one morning to ask for Katherine&rsquo;s
assistance with some new music, found all so busy that she forgot
her violin and, begging a large apron, sat down at the
dining-room table with the others and began to stone cherries
with vigor and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Strawberries, when they came in season, were ordered in large
quantities from the market, as not enough were grown upon the
place to answer the purpose. In due time, currant jelly was to be
put up, and the pears&mdash;for this was a pear year&mdash;were
to be turned to account.</p>
<p><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>Mrs.
Ward had ordered a liberal quantity of all varieties of
preserves, and a message came from Mrs. Madison begging that she
also might have the privilege of ordering some. All that were
left were to be sent to the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange in Boston, to
be sold.</p>
<p>It was hot work, no doubt, and there were pleasanter things to
be done in summer time than stirring with a long spoon in a
kettle full of steaming fruit; but it was a source of great
satisfaction to the girls to feel that they were making money as
well now as when school and music pupils occupied their time, and
it was certainly a far more entertaining way than that. The
preserving days at Glen Arden proved to be the gayest of the
summer; and Roger Madison, hearing about them from his sister,
deliberately remained away from his law office one morning and,
presenting himself at Glen Arden, begged for something to do,
upon which they set him to stemming currants, with strict
injunctions not to taste.</p>
<p>The week which followed the robbery passed away in this wise,
and then one morning came the information that the stolen silver
had been traced. Some of the articles had been found in <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>a pawn-shop
in Boston, having been left there by a young man&mdash;almost a
boy, in fact&mdash;of slight figure, and with very light
tow-colored hair. His eyes were peculiar, and would probably lead
to his detection. They had a way of shifting uneasily, and of not
meeting those of the person to whom he spoke.</p>
<p>This description fitted Dave exactly, with the exception of
the part referring to the eyes. Dave had very good eyes, the
Starrs thought, and a perfectly straightforward manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably, since he did this dreadful thing,&rdquo; said
Victoria, sadly, &ldquo;his eyes have changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he did it,&rdquo; said Peter,
stubbornly. &ldquo;I shall never believe it unless he tells me so
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a very short time, the suspected burglar was arrested,
and it was found that his name was Carney! Roger Madison went to
the jail to see him, and there, to his astonishment, found that
it was James, and not David Carney. This young man closely
resembled him, to be sure, but he was older, and his face had a
totally different expression. He was David&rsquo;s brother. His
accomplice was also arrested, a much older man <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>than
himself, and most of the stolen property was recovered.</p>
<p>The question now was, where was Dave? Was he also implicated,
and had he for that reason run away? At all events, he had
completely disappeared, and as the summer days passed by, and
still there was no word of him, the Starrs gave up all hope of
ever seeing him again. They did not wish, however, that any
search should be made for him.</p>
<p>The elder Carney confessed that he had entered the house by
way of the second-story window, which proved that Sophy had not
dreamed that he went through the room, while his close
resemblance to his brother easily accounted for the mistake of
thinking that it was Dave. The only wonder was, that no one had
remembered the brother before, but as he had been seen only by
Peter and Sophy, perhaps that was not surprising.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One day, in early September, when the sky was blue, and
goldenrod and asters were in bloom, when the birds were preparing
for their flight southward, and squirrels were busy with their <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>preparations for the winter, Victoria, Peter, and Sophy
were walking home from Ashmont, two miles away. They left the
road at a certain point, and striking into the woods, followed a
scarcely perceptible path, which would in time bring them to
their own pasture land.</p>
<p>It was a glorious day to be out of doors, and in the free
woods. The air was cool and crisp, and yet the sun had a certain
warmth which was good to feel when they emerged from the woods
and found themselves beneath the open sky.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s leg was entirely well now, and he walked without
even the suggestion of a limp. The accident had been a severe
trial in many ways, but his sisters had said to one another more
than once during the summer, that Peter had borne it manfully,
and had proved that he was possessed of plenty of pluck. He was
much less impatient of control, than he once had been, and indeed
the girls were less exacting. Honor and Katherine discovered,
slowly but surely, that there were other ways of influencing
Peter, and probably all boys, than by argument or command, and
they acknowledged, at last, that Victoria&rsquo;s method was more
efficacious than theirs.</p>
<p><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>&ldquo;Suppose we sit on the rock for a while,&rdquo;
said Vic, as they walked along the cart road in the pasture.
&ldquo;It is too lovely to go indoors, or even to go home.
Vacation will soon be over, and we had better make the most of
our few days. Heigh-ho! I don&rsquo;t want to go back to school a
bit. I did hope that I could stay at home after this, and help
the others, but they all seem to think it is more my duty to go
for another year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had climbed the huge mass of rock which long ages ago had
been piled there in gigantic confusion. Lichen grew over it now,
bushes had found root in the crevices, and mosses and grass made
soft resting-places upon the top. It was Victoria&rsquo;s
favorite spot upon the place, and she particularly loved it on a
golden September day like the present one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d mind your school a
bit,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;What would you do if you had to go
to that hateful one that I go to? Do you know, Vic, I&rsquo;ve
half a mind to accept Aunt Sophia&rsquo;s offer and go to
boarding-school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, you don&rsquo;t really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I was talking to Mr. Madison the other day,
and he advised me to. He thinks I&rsquo;ll <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>get a
better education. And after all, Vic, it&rsquo;s pretty good of
Aunt Sophia to offer it again after our refusing everything last
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Victoria; &ldquo;I feel as if we
had misjudged Aunt Sophia. She means to be kind to us, and if she
has that unfortunate way of acting as if she wanted to run the
entire universe, I suppose we ought to make the best of it. It is
only her disposition, and as she has had plenty of money all her
life, and no one to interfere with her, I suppose there is some
excuse for it. She really has been very nice this summer, and it
didn&rsquo;t turn out as badly as I was afraid it would. After
all, Peter, I think you are right. We oughtn&rsquo;t to refuse
everything she offers, and it would be of great advantage to you
to go to St. Asaph&rsquo;s. If only she allows the rest of us to
continue to earn our living in peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Vic!&rdquo; exclaimed Sophy, in an excited
whisper. &ldquo;Who is that peeping up over the river bank? Look,
Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gazed in the direction that Sophy indicated, but could
see nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was somebody,&rdquo; continued Sophy,
still in the same eager whisper, &ldquo;and it looked like Dave
Carney!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>At
this Peter jumped to his feet, and nimbly leaping from rock to
rock, ran to the river bank some little distance away. The girls
watched him. They saw that he was speaking to some one below the
bank. He did not return, and unable to restrain their curiosity
further, they too left the rock and followed him. They found him
in earnest conversation with a boy in a boat, and that boy was
David Carney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dave!&rdquo; cried Victoria; &ldquo;have you come
back? I am so glad to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave shyly pulled off his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he hasn&rsquo;t come back to us,&rdquo; said
Peter. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean us to see him. He only came to
take a look at the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you run away, Dave?&rdquo; asked Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran away because I knowed it was Jim,&rdquo; said
Carney, looking up at her as she stood above him on the bank.
&ldquo;He always said he was agoing to break into your house
sometime. He wanted me to help, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have nothing
to do with it. That made him mad, and we had a quarrel. Jim got
into bad company down at Fordham, and I guess they got him into
this scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>&ldquo;I always thought your brother couldn&rsquo;t be
a very nice person,&rdquo; said Sophy, who had been watching Dave
with round and solemn eyes. &ldquo;He used regular swear words
that day I met him with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been as bad myself if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for you folks,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have gone
straight after him if you hadn&rsquo;t caught me that time when I
was stealing those apples,&rdquo; he added, looking at Peter.
&ldquo;I only did that because I was hungry. It was the first
time, but I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t have been the last. That
morning when they told me there&rsquo;d been a robbery, I knowed
it was Jim, and I couldn&rsquo;t stay. I knowed you&rsquo;d think
it was me that done it if I ran away, but I couldn&rsquo;t stay
in the place where you folks had been so good to me, and my own
brother had broke into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing ever since?&rdquo; asked
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hid for a few days. Then I heard Jim was caught, so
after that I went to Boston and got some work off and on down on
the wharves. I&rsquo;m out of it now, and I came out to Fordham,
and a fellow I know loaned me this here boat, and I <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>couldn&rsquo;t help coming up to see how it looked
here. I didn&rsquo;t mean you to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you come back to us now?&rdquo; asked
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; repeated Dave. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
want me to come back, and me running away, and having a brother
in jail for robbing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! I never supposed you had anything to do
with it. I said so all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s eyes rested upon the other boy&rsquo;s face with
an expression of dog-like devotion. Then he turned to
Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he never did think so,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but
I must confess, Dave, that when you ran away, the rest of us
doubted you. But we must talk to my sisters about it. Will you
come up to-night and hear what they think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Carney promised that he would.</p>
<p>The Starrs returned to the house in great excitement, eager to
impart their news to the sisters at once, but they found a still
greater surprise awaiting them. On the piazza were Aunt Sophia
and Mr. Abbott in earnest conversation. Mr. Abbott, whom they had
not seen at Glen Arden for so many months! He had been abroad for
his <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>health, and although his wards knew that his steamer
was in, they had scarcely expected to see him so soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Dickinson,&rdquo; Mrs. Wentworth
Ward was saying as Peter and his sisters came around the corner
of the house, &ldquo;even though I so strongly disapproved of
their plans at first, I am really quite proud of the girls. They
have done well, and they deserve to succeed. If Peter will only
do as I wish and go to St. Asaph&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she stopped, for Peter himself came into sight, but her
remarks proved that in spite of all that had been said to the
contrary, Mrs. Wentworth Ward was broad-minded enough to know
when she was mistaken, and generous enough to acknowledge the
fact.</p>
<p>Honor and Katherine came home from an errand which they had
been doing at almost the same moment that Peter and the younger
sisters returned, and the welcome which Mr. Abbott received
proved that they were indeed glad to see him again.</p>
<p>There was much to be told to him, the history of the summer
and of the robbery, and now the account that Peter and Vic had to
give of the <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>meeting with Carney. They were so sure of Dave&rsquo;s
innocence of any complicity in the affair that it was impossible
for the others not to be impressed by their story, and even Mrs.
Wentworth Ward gave an unwilling assent to his being taken back
for another trial. Therefore it was decided that when Dave should
come for his answer that night he was to be told to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about these Madisons whom I hear quoted so
much?&rdquo; said Mr. Abbott, looking quizzically from one to the
other of his wards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nicest people in the world,&rdquo; said Katherine,
eagerly. &ldquo;We have had such a lovely time with them this
summer, Mr. Abbott! Miss Madison is the most charming woman I
ever knew. We play together a great deal, she on the violin and I
on the piano. There is a brother, Roger, too, who is very nice.
We all like them immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victoria, Peter, and Sophy joined in the chorus of praise, as
did even Mrs. Wentworth Ward, but Honor was noticeably
silent.</p>
<p>Mr. Abbott remained to dinner and even to supper also, staying
long enough to see Dave Carney and convince himself, as he did
the moment he looked at him, that he was an honest fellow. He <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>also
desired to meet Miss Madison and her brother, about whom he had
heard so much. When he finally returned to Boston, there was a
twinkle in his kind eyes and a satisfied expression upon his
face.</p>
<p>He had heard now a complete history of the past year, and he
felt confident that the coming one would be even more of a
success. The Starrs had tried their wings and had proved that
they could fly.</p>
<p>That same evening Mrs. Wentworth Ward called Victoria into her
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you remember what I
said to you one day in the early summer in regard to Katherine
and young Madison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Sophia, I do indeed!&rdquo; replied Vic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you something else, then,&rdquo; said
her aunt. &ldquo;I think I was mistaken. In fact, I find that I
have made a number of mistakes about you all. I think now that it
is friendship, mere friendship, between him and Katherine. It is
very rare, but this time I believe it to be the case. Katherine
finds the sister more absorbing and interesting than the brother,
and the real object of his interest is not Katherine, but Honor.
I think you will find that I am right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 400</span>And
after events proved, greatly to Mrs. Wentworth Ward&rsquo;s own
satisfaction, and indeed to that of all concerned, that she had
indeed guessed correctly.</p>
<p>And when Honor was told by Roger and Victoria together that he
was &ldquo;the man who bought the etching,&rdquo; she took the
news so quietly that Victoria came to the conclusion that
much-dreaded events never turn out to be as unpleasant as one
fears that they will be,&mdash;a conclusion that was frequently
proved to be a true one during the remainder of her life.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
